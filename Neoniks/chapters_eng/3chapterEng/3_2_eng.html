            <p style="text-align: justify;">Seething with rage, Phoebe looked
              into his room. Just as she thought! Jay poured water into the
              first bowl that came handy, added a ball of magic to it, and
              created a screen for a multi-player video game.<br>
              <br>
              It was times like these that Phoebe wanted to send her brother to
              the Brickoven Desert or some other place even further and nastier
              – just so he’d know not to take other people’s things!<br>
              <br>
              She had a brilliant idea – what if she inspired Jay to study the
              Crazy Cactuses that grew in the desert? They were very interesting
              plants with quite a unique sense of humor – they threw prickly
              balls at the passersby and roared with laughter if they scored a
              hit. If Jay became interested in them, he’d ask their parents to
              send him to the Brickoven Summer Camp.<br>

          <td style="text-align: justify;" valign="middle" width="50%">Phoebe
            had a tiny ball of magic left after the club session and it was just
            enough to create a little winged watering can that the muses called
            the Fount of Inspiration.<br>
            <br>
            Humming quietly, the can flew towards Jay to shed the special Light
            of Knowledge on him, but he caught it in his fist.<br>
            <br>
            “Careful!” yelled Phoebe. “You’ll crush my Inspiration! Let it go
            now!”<br>
            <br>
            “No way!” said Jay.<br>
            <br>
            Wings sprouted behind the kids’ backs. Following Jay up to the
            ceiling, Phoebe began chasing him around. <br>
