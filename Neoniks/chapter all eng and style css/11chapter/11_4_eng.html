<p class="indent">&#x201C;Stop! Who&#x0027;s there?&#x201D; cried the girl.</p>
<p class="indent">Mystie wanted to yell to attract attention, but Wanda squeezed her jaws with her fingers.</p>

<p class="indent">&#x201C;So you&#x0027;re still alive?&#x201D; she hissed. &#x201C;Then be quiet or I&#x0027;ll make a bath rug out of you!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">When the girl saw that it was just a leoman, she calmed down right away. &#x201C;Hello! Did something happen? I saw a bright flare above.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">It looked like she hadn&#x0027;t realized what happened to the starry flower. Her magic staff was just fine &#x2013; the paralyzing energy had not reached the plantation.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Nothing happened,&#x201D; mumbled Justacreep. &#x201C;It&#x0027;s just the kids fooling around, setting off firecrackers for the Festival. My boss said there is some kind of infection in the greenhouse. I&#x0027;ve got to check it out, so it doesn&#x0027;t spread to the big trees. What&#x0027;s your name, kiddo?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Lola,&#x201D; replied the girl. &#x201C;I am the Star Fairies&#x2019; apprentice. They are guiding the starry flower up and left me to keep an eye on things.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Let&#x0027;s hurry to the greenhouse,&#x201D; said Justacreep. &#x201C;I want to get back home in time for the festival concert.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">He was so good at pretending to be a magic tree expert that neither the girl nor her staff suspected anything.</p>
