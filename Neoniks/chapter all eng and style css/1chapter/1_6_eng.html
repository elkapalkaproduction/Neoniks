                    <p class="indent">The fox nodded and began tickling Jay with her soft paws by running all over him. They played for a long time, trying not to laugh too loudly;then the fox wrapped herself around Jay&#x0027;s wrist like a bracelet and a wave of violet light went over her soft fur. Jay noticed this happening every time she was happy.&#x201C;I&#x0027;ll sleep here,&#x201D; said the fox. &#x201C;It&#x0027;s the most comfortable place in the world. Have you decided what to name me?&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">Jay thought for a bit. &#x201C;How about Mystie?&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;That&#x0027;ll work,&#x201D; said the fox and closed her eyes. &#x201C;Good night!&#x201D;</p>
