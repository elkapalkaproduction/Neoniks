                    <p class="indent">Leomen kids drove around town on bikes with sparkling wheels. Instead of trees there were dandelions as tall as palm trees, with filaments that shone in the gloom.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The leoman that saved Phoebe introduced himself. &#x201C;My name&#x0027;s Ruben, what&#x0027;s yours?&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;I&#x0027;m Phoebe,&#x201D; she replied. &#x201C;I wanted to help my little brother save his fox &#x2013; she was stolen by an evil teacher. But I fell off the Sky Scooter and got lost. I have to get back to the top; Jay will be worried.&#x201D;</p>
                    
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;You&#x0027;ll have to wait,&#x201D; said Ruben. &#x201C;The Star Fairies are going to raise the magic for the Jubilant Moon Festival now, so the exit from the volcano must be completely clear.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Where do they raise it from?&#x201D; asked Phoebe confusedly.</p>

                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;From the magic tree plantation, which is directly below us, at the bottom of the volcano,&#x201D; explained Ruben. &#x201C;That&#x0027;s where the magic we all use is grown. The access to the trees is blocked by a powerful magic field called the Border of Darkness, so that outsiders cannot sneak onto the plantation. If you fly into the magic field, you&#x0027;ll think that you are going down and down forever, while all the time you&#x0027;d be staying in one place. That&#x0027;s why our island is called Bottomless.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">Phoebe&#x0027;s eyes lit up. &#x201C;Have you ever been to the plantation yourself?&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">The leomen looked at each other and smiled.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;We all work there. Some of us do maintenance, some are agricultural engineers,&#x201D; answered Ruben. &#x201C;Today the Border of Darkness will be shut down for a little while so the magic for the fireworks can go through. If you want, you can see how it&#x0027;s raised. It&#x0027;s a very beautiful sight.&#x201D;</p>
