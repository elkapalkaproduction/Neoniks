The            hat fell off his skull and with a clatter landed on a nearby            stalagmite. His fingers fell open and the Greedy Miner let go of            Mystie. Once she was on the floor, she ran to the magic tree and hid            in its crown.<br>            <br>            “Furcoat, what’s going on?” screamed Justacreep. “Why did you call            this monster? Why did you waste so much magic on him? We wanted to            grow a tree…”<br>            <br>            “Shut up and do as you’re told,” snapped Furcoat. “Put me on the            skeleton!”<br>            <br>            Justacreep was only too happy to get rid of him. He watched for the            right moment and then put the Miner’s arms into the sleeves and            flung Furcoat’s face over his skull. <br>            <br>          </td>          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>          <td style="text-align: justify;" valign="middle" width="50%">            <p style="text-align: center;" class="images"><img style="width: 350px; height: 353px;"                src="images/58_furcoat.jpg"                alt=""></p>            <p style="text-align: center;" class="images"><span style="font-style: italic;">Furcoat                gets a new body</span></p>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 169 - </td>          <td><br>          </td>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 170 - </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </body></html>
