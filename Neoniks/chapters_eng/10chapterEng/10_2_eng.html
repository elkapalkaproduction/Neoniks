Sunlight could not reach this              far down, so the streets of Leoville were full of lanterns and              numerous signs that were ablaze with light and advertised all              sorts of nonsense: “This is a Fence” or “Here is a Comfortable              Bench.” Phoebe even noticed a sign that said “Nothing Ever Happens              Here.”<br>              <br>              Leomen's kids drove around town on bikes with sparkling wheels.              Instead of trees there were dandelions as tall as palm trees, with              filaments that shone in the gloom.<br>              <br>              The Leoman that saved Phoebe introduced himself. “My name’s Ruben,              what’s yours?”<br>              <br>              “I’m Phoebe,” she replied. “I wanted to help my little brother              save his fox – she was stolen by a substitute teacher. But I fell              off the Sky Scooter and got lost. I have to get back to the top;              Jay will be worried.”</div>            <br>          </td>          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>          <td valign="middle" width="50%">            <div style="text-align: justify;">“You’ll have to wait,” said Ruben.              “The Star Fairies are going to raise the magic for the Jubilant              Moon Festival now, so the exit from the volcano must be completely              clear.”<br>              <br>              “Where do they raise it from?” asked Phoebe confusedly. <br>              <br>              “From the magic tree plantation, which is directly below us, at              the bottom of the volcano,” explained Ruben. “That’s where the              magic we all use is grown. The access to the trees is blocked by a              powerful magic field called the Border of Darkness, so that              outsiders cannot sneak onto the plantation. If you fly into the              magic field, you’ll think that you are going down and down              forever, while all the time you’d be staying in one place. That’s              why our island is called Bottomless.”<br>              <br>              Phoebe’s eyes lit up. “Have you ever been to the plantation              yourself?”<br>              <br>              <br>            </div>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 123 - </td>          <td><br>          </td>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 124 - </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </body></html>
