                    <p class="indent">Sea Dog&#x0027;s bubble spun in the air for a moment and then turned into a pink figure in a top hat.</p>

           <p class="indent">&#x201C;Yesterday morning I had a visit from a man in a top hat and a fur coat,&#x201D; he admitted. &#x201C;The man introduced himself as a member of the Moral Standards Society and he said that he admired my exploits very much. He asked for permission to tell about them in his book entitled <em>Heroes Among Us</em> and I let him into the house.&#x201D;</p>
           <p class="indent">Sea Dog made another bubble that turned into his own pink image.</p>
           <p class="indent">&#x201C;Oh, my!&#x201D; squeaked miniature Justacreep. &#x201C;I&#x0027;m going to die of admiration! You are not just a hero; you are an Educator with a capital E! I must give you my dearest possession &#x2013; my fur coat.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;My own skin&#x0027;s warm enough,&#x201D; the little Sea Dog said, but little Justacreep would not listen.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Oh, no, you must try it on! You can&#x0027;t even imagine how well the collar goes with your face!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">But as soon as the little Sea Dog put on little Justacreep&#x0027;s fur coat, it squeezed him so hard that he couldn&#x0027;t even move his tail.</p>
