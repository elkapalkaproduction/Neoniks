Fire hockey was not only the              most spectacular, but also the most dangerous sport on Cake              Island. During the game the dragons skated on ice on sharpened              claws with great speed, wearing safety helmets and armor.<br>              <br>              Part of the team was made up of fire-breathing dragons who melted              the ice in front of their opponents coming on with the puck. If              they did it well, the forward would fall flat on his nose in the              mud. <br>              <br>              But it wasn’t that easy to stop him because he was always followed              by frost-breathing dragons. They tried to make an ice slide for              him, so that the forward would be able to get to the post and              score a goal with his tail.</div>          </td>          <td valign="middle" width="50%">            <p style="text-align: center;" class="images"><img style="width: 430px; height: 281px;"                src="images/29_fire_hockey.jpg"                alt=""></p>            <p style="text-align: center;" class="images"><span style="font-style: italic;">Dragons                playing fire hockey<br>              </span></p>            <br>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 81 - </td>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 82 - </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </body></html>
