                    <p class="indent">Justacreep put two fingers in his mouth and whistled; in a minute, a large crocorhine ran up to him.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Guard them!&#x201D; commanded Justacreep. &#x201C;And if they cry too loudly, fill the well with dirt.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">He picked up Wanda, and soon the humming of the submarine receded to nothing.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The well was so dark that Jay and Phoebe could not even see their own hands.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;What if no one ever finds us?&#x201D; said Jay nervously. &#x201C;Zoe went for help, but she&#x0027;s a turtle&#x2026; who knows when she&#x0027;ll get to town?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Let&#x0027;s see where Justacreep is taking Mystie,&#x201D; suggested Phoebe. &#x201C;She&#x0027;s much worse off than we are right now.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Jay pulled Zoe&#x0027;s red button out of his pocket and turned on the map of the island.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Here she is!&#x201D; said Phoebe pointing to a shining dot in the middle of the maze. &#x201C;What do you think Furcoat wants your fox for?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">But Jay did not answer. In the glow of the map he noticed that there was a puddle of water at the bottom of the well.</p>

                </td>
             <td width="50%" valign="middle">
                 <p class="indent">&#x201C;I know how to restore at least one pair of wings!&#x201D; he whispered. &#x201C;Put a small ball of magic into that puddle! I hope what&#x0027;s left of my Will Power is enough for this trick.&#x201D;</p>
                 <p class="images"><img width="50%" src="images/55_magic_in_the_pool.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="indent">Jay cast the video game spell, and as soon as the water turned into a screen, Beppo&#x0027;s face appeared on it.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Hey, where are you?&#x201D; he asked. &#x201C;I&#x0027;ve called you, like, five times.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Quiet!&#x201D; whispered Jay and picked up the double ball of magic. &#x201C;I&#x0027;ll tell you about it later. Right now I need your help. Is your Will Power level okay?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;I think so,&#x201D; said Beppo.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Then say the Winged Spell for me! But please hurry, it&#x0027;s really important!&#x201D;</p>
