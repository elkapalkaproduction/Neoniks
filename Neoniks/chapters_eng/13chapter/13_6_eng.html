                    <p class="indent">Harold zoomed past on the Sky Scooter. He could hardly fit on the narrow seat, but he drove it splendidly. After circling once, he flew up to Phoebe and Jay.</p>

                 <p class="indent">&#x201C;The good magicians found the Sky Scooter &#x2013; it was flying above the magic plantation.&#x201D; Harold pulled a handlebar and rolled over. &#x201C;Look, I&#x0027;m a real flying dragon now!&#x201D;</p>
                 <p class="indent">&#x201C;And I can&#x0027;t fly at all,&#x201D; sighed Phoebe. &#x201C;Mom will be awfully upset when she finds out.&#x201D;</p>
                 <p class="indent">A giant policewoman was walking by with the magic tree in her arms. All of a sudden, its heart began to beat so loudly that she stopped. &#x201C;What&#x0027;s the matter with it?&#x201D; she wondered.</p>
                 
                 
                 <p class="indent">Phoebe and Jay came over to her. A window of the painted house opened, a tiny man looked out and threw a double ball of magic right into Phoebe&#x0027;s hands.</p>
                 <p class="indent">&#x201C;I think he wants to thank us for saving the tree!&#x201D; cried Jay delightedly. &#x201C;It&#x0027;s his home, after all.&#x201D;</p>
                 <p class="indent">Phoebe bowed to the tiny man. &#x201C;Thank you! I&#x0027;ll restore my wings as soon as I get home and find the text for the Winged Spell.&#x201D;</p>
