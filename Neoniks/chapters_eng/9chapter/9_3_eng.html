<p class="indent">Justacreep turned on the light bulb on the ceiling, and Wanda could finally swallow the ball of magic and go back to her usual state. She jumped out of Justacreep&#x0027;s hands and vigorously hopped around the room.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Let&#x0027;s hurry up and finish our submarine!&#x201D; she cried.</p>
<p class="indent">Justacreep took off Furcoat, hung him up on a horned coatrack, and took the demonite out of his pocket.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;So much work! So much trouble!&#x201D; he said holding the demonite against the light. &#x201C;We&#x0027;ve been collecting these rocks for over a year now. But the greatest actor of our times will sharpen claws in a locker room no more!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;I just want it to work!&#x201D; said Wanda impatiently.</p>

                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Don&#x0027;t worry, it will,&#x201D; sneered Furcoat. &#x201C;When I was a living creature and not just a piece of clothing, I worked at the Border of Darkness, so I know how things are run there. All the detectors are set to catch intruders who use magic, and the guards won&#x0027;t even think that anyone would try to cross the border without magical devices. If Wanda and I are surrounded by a thick layer of demonite, we won&#x0027;t show on the screens, and the &#x2018;greatest actor of our times&#x2019; doesn&#x0027;t count, he hasn&#x0027;t got an ounce of magic in him.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;I&#x0027;ve got plenty of talent though!&#x201D; replied Justacreep proudly.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Big deal!&#x201D; snorted Wanda. &#x201C;I&#x0027;ve got tons of talents myself. I can cry with a single eye and chew with a single tooth.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;And think with a single brain cell,&#x201D; giggled Justacreep.</p>
<p class="indent">Wanda jumped onto his foot so hard that Justacreep howled. &#x201C;Ouch, Furcoat, tell her to keep her handle to herself!&#x201D;</p>
