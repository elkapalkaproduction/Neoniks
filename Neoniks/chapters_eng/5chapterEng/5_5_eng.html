Should we go there?”<br>              <br>              “Definitely!” exclaimed Phoebe. “We should find out why Mr.              Justacreep wanted to get into the museum.”<br>              <br>              Sea Dog was not one for flying and preferred to use a boat to get              to work. He was so good at driving it that he could get there in              record time, despite the island’s rapids and waterfalls. <br>              <br>              Going down-river with the teacher was exciting but a bit scary,              just like riding a very wet rollercoaster. Every once in a while              Phoebe’s and Jay’s wings came out on their own – that’s how much              they wanted to go up and fly away from the boat.</div>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 65 - </td>          <td><br>          </td>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 66 - </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </body></html>
