<p class="indent">&#x201C;Please don&#x0027;t get distracted!&#x201D; begged Jay. &#x201C;You&#x0027;ve got to save Mystie.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Suddenly the cats cocked their ears, looked at each other, and fled every which way.</p>
<p class="indent">Phoebe heard a dull hum, little winged knights were heading straight for her. They were wearing armor and held sharp spears in their hands.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Leave our flowerz-z-z alone!&#x201D; buzzed the little knights.</p>

<p class="indent">Phoebe wanted to say that she hadn&#x0027;t touched anything, but at that very moment a tiny spear struck her seat.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;What are you doing?&#x201D; yelled Phoebe and hurriedly pulled the Sky Scooter down.</p>
<p class="indent">Trying to get away, she flew into someone&#x0027;s hanging garden where shimmering pumpkins and squashes were dangling from a stone ceiling. Their leaves intertwined, and Phoebe barely avoided crashing into something.</p>
<p class="indent">Jay&#x0027;s worried voice came over the intercom, &#x201C;What happened?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;A-a-ah!&#x201D; screamed Phoebe. &#x201C;I&#x0027;ve been attacked!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;By who?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">But she did not have time to explain.</p>
