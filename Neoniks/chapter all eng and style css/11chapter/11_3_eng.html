<p class="indent">&#x201C;Don&#x0027;t forget the gloves or your hands will give you away,&#x201D; said Wanda.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Like I wouldn&#x0027;t know that,&#x201D; grumbled Justacreep as he pulled the gloves on. Now he looked as if he were a real old leoman, just overdressed a little, his cloak covering his entire body.</p>
<p class="indent">All this time Mystie had been motionless around Wanda&#x0027;s neck. Her paws were tied and she could not get away.</p>
<p class="indent">Suddenly, they heard hurried steps and her heart quickened: Could help be on its way? Maybe someone would come and set her free?</p>
<p class="indent">A young Star Fairy appeared among the trees. She held a staff with a knob that looked like a saucer. It had an old man&#x0027;s face on one side and a young man&#x0027;s face on the other.</p>
