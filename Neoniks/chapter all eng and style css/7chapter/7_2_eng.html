    <p class="indent">The dragon was not paying much attention to him &#x2013; he was used to Justacreep flattering famous athletes.</p>
<p class="indent">The other dragons were sitting on the benches and helping each other tighten their armor straps. Fire hockey was not only the most spectacular, but also the most dangerous sport on Cake Island. During the game the dragons skated on ice on sharpened claws with great speed, wearing safety helmets and armor.</p>
<p class="indent">Part of the team was made up of fire-breathing dragons who melted the ice in front of their opponents coming on with the puck. If they did it well, the forward would fall flat on his nose in the mud. But it wasn&#x0027;t that easy to stop him because he was always followed by frost-breathing dragons. They tried to make an ice slide for him, so that the forward would be able to get to the post and score a goal with his tail.</p>

         <p class="indent">Mystie looked for Furcoat and Wanda, but she could not see them anywhere. She thought Justacreep wasn&#x0027;t looking and tried to crawl from under the cup and run away. But the green dragon noticed her.</p>
         <p class="indent">&#x201C;Oh, how cute!&#x201D; he roared enthusiastically. &#x201C;Can I pet it?&#x201D;</p>
         <p class="indent">Justacreep quickly grabbed Mystie, put her back in the cup, and covered it with a plastic lid.</p>
