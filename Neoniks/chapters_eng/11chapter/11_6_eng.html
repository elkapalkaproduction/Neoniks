<p class="indent">All the magic of the staff flowed into Wanda, and after a long kiss the staff clattered to the ground. Both its faces froze into wooden masks.</p>
<p class="indent">Wanda patted her stomach in satisfaction. &#x201C;I think I&#x0027;m going burst with all this magic!&#x201D; she said, and hopped after Justacreep and Lola.</p>
<p class="indent">Magic tree seedlings were planted in trays and buckets and raised there for several years until their trunks were large enough to house the painted people.</p>
<p class="images"><img width="50%" src="images/53_magic_tree.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="indent">Half-grown trees, ready to join the others, stood by the greenhouse entrance. Their hearts were tiny and only one or two houses could fit on their bark.Justacreep sprinkled some demonite powder over one of the trees while Lola wasn&#x0027;t looking. </p>
                </td>
                <td width="50%" valign="middle">

<p class="indent">Right away its leaves turned black, as if burned.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Gosh! You&#x0027;ve got plague fever here!&#x201D; cried Justacreep. &#x201C;It&#x0027;s a terrible disease that can spread through the entire plantation! I have to take this specimen to the lab and run some tests.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Poor little tree!&#x201D; gasped Lola, horrified. &#x201C;Are you sure it can be taken out of the greenhouse?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;That&#x0027;s what I am here for,&#x201D; said Justacreep.</p>
<p class="indent">Mystie realized that she did not have a moment to spare. She made herself remember how happily she had played with Jay. It was such a happy thought that a wave of violet light ran over her fur.</p>
<p class="indent">Lola&#x0027;s mouth fell open when she saw it. &#x201C;Is this a real magic fox?&#x201D; she cried. &#x201C;I play that game too! Tell me, how did you get to the last level?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Wanda had no idea what to tell her and looked at Justacreep confusedly.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Um&#x2026; I bought that fox in the market and we made a collar of it,&#x201D; he began, but Lola interrupted him.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Are you crazy? That fox is her master&#x0027;s friend!&#x201D;</p>
