Jay thought it would show that he had no Will              Power left because he did not do his homework and lied to Mom. But              it was not that bad – after all, he completed a large project and              that brought his Will Power up quite a bit. <br>              <br>              “Stay here,” Jay told Mystie and went to see what was happening in              the house.<br>              <br>              Dad was not back yet, Phoebe was still asleep, and Mom already              flew to the Museum of Unnatural History where she worked as a              senior magic consultant. <br>              <br>              The coast to the kitchen was clear but as soon as Jay walked up to              the refrigerator he saw Rusty Pomodoro stuck to a fridge magnet by              his armor.<br>            </div>          </td>          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>          <td valign="middle" width="50%">            <p class="images"><br>            </p>            <div style="text-align: justify;">“I am holding up this door so it              does not fall off,” said the little knight. “I did not even follow              Milady to work, although she had asked me at some length.”<br>              <br>              “Yeah, sure,” grumbled Jay, taking him off the door. “How many              times do we have to tell you that it’s not real ice cream in there              – it’s just a ghost that Mom is growing?”<br>              <br>              “So our ice cream has been enchanted!” cried Rusty and brandished              his sword. “I shall find the culprit and destroy him!”<br>              <br>              Jay got some yogurt and went back to his room.<br>              <br>              “You can’t stay at home,” he told Mystie. “Rusty’s going to look              for enemies today and if he finds you he’ll make a scene and will              threaten to go on a long quest and die fighting a dragon.”</div>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 19 - </td>          <td><br>          </td>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 20 - </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </body></html>
