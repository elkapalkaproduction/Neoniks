I want the              same one but alive. She’ll be smart, kind, and brave, and we’ll be              the best friends ever.”<br>              <br>              “You already have me,” teased his sister.<br>              <br>              Jay could only sigh.</div>          </td>          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>          <td style="text-align: center; width: 531.5px;" valign="middle"><img style="width: 218px; height: 300px;"              alt=""              src="images/02_jay_with_wings.jpg"><br>            <br>            <em>Jay the Little Wizard</em></td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td align="center" height="1%">- 1 -<br>          </td>          <td><br>          </td>          <td align="center" height="1%">&nbsp;- 2 - </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </body></html>
