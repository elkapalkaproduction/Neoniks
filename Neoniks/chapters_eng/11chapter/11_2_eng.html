 <p class="indent">Justacreep bent down and gasped when he saw a painted man running along a path with a cart loaded with a tiny ball of magic. Reaching the roots that came above ground, the man dropped his load onto the grass and hurried back.</p>

<p class="indent">Justacreep picked up the ball of magic. &#x201C;Is it real? It&#x0027;s amazing!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Hey, Furcoat, why are they throwing it away?&#x201D; asked Wanda.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;No one knows,&#x201D; he answered. &#x201C;The painted people live in their own world and don&#x0027;t have a clue that we even exist. We, on the other hand, can neither talk to them, nor send them a message, they can&#x0027;t see or hear us. Only one thing is clear &#x2013; they make magic in their workshops and then drop it on the ground.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Oh boy, do I need a tree like that!&#x201D; cried Justacreep.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;It all depends on you and Wanda now,&#x201D; said Furcoat. &#x201C;I helped you to get here, now it&#x0027;s your turn.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Don&#x0027;t worry!&#x201D; Justacreep grinned. &#x201C;You are talking to the greatest actor of our times!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">He put a long cloak over Furcoat, unclasped the lining at the collar, and put Furcoat&#x0027;s face on like a mask.</p>
