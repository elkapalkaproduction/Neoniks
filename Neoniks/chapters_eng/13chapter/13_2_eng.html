                 <p class="indent">The skeleton turned his head and moaned, chattering his yellow teeth, &#x201C;Where is my rat?&#x201D;</p>
                 <p class="indent">&#x201C;Give him the fox!&#x201D; said Furcoat to Justacreep. &#x201C;He can&#x0027;t tell the difference. It just has to be a small magical creature!&#x201D;</p>
                 <p class="indent">The skeleton stepped out of the magic circle and moved forward, extending his bony arms. &#x201C;Where is my ratty-matey?!&#x201D;</p>
                 <p class="indent">Justacreep shoved the terrified Mystie towards him.</p>
                 <p class="indent">&#x201C;My dear!&#x201D; mumbled the skeleton and pressed Mystie to a spot where he used to have a cheek. &#x201C;My curse is lifted!&#x201D;</p>
                 <p class="indent">He began to grow muscles and skin right in front of their eyes. The hat fell off his skull and with a clatter landed on a nearby stalagmite. His fingers fell open and the Greedy Miner let go of Mystie. Once she was on the floor, she ran to the magic tree and hid in its crown.</p>
