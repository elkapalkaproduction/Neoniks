After they            tied me to the railing, Justacreep called the school and told them            in my voice that I was sick and that there will be a substitute.            That man is a first-class actor!”<br>            <br>            “And a first-class thief,” said Jay gloomily. “He stole my magic            fox, and Cary’s lacegrass, and your key.”<br>            <br>            “I think these crooks decided to rob our museum,” said Phoebe. “They            couldn’t simply get into the school: that’s why they made up the            story about the sub.
