                    <p class="indent">When he left, Wanda the wand hopped around the classroom and barked out commands: &#x201C;If you don&#x0027;t listen to me I&#x0027;ll turn you into old socks with holes! No talking, no breathing, no blinking! Just sit there and be frightened!&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Why should we be afraid?&#x201D; asked a girl.&#x201C;I&#x0027;ll tell you such scary stories that your hair will rise on end!&#x201D;<em>I&#x0027;m off the hook</em>, thought Jay. The only thing he was afraid of was questions about his homework.Wanda lowered the blinds on the windows and the room became very dark.</p>
