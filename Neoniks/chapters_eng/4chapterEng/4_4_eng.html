They were right to            throw you out of the Magic Wand College for academic failure.’ He            was very rude to her.”<br>            <br>            “Did they say anything about my fox?” asked Jay.<br>            <br>            “That’s right,” said Cary, “they mentioned a fox that had passed            out.”<br>          </td>          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>          <td valign="middle" width="50%">            <div style="text-align: justify;">“Did they hurt her?” cried Jay,              shocked.<br>              <br>              “I don’t know.
