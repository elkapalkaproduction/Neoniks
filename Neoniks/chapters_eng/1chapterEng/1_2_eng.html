She never gave it to              him! And when you are that greedy – it doesn’t really matter how              smart you are.<br>              <br>              Jay had to use his own wand to do magic. He called it “spaghetti”              – it was long, smooth, and had no decorations except an              inscription that said: <span style="font-style: italic;">May turn                into a pencil, a spoon, a comb, or a locker key.</span><br>              <br>              Jay spent a long time going through library scrolls and consulting              the shadows of famous scientists to figure out how to make his              wand more potent. Only when he had taken it apart and inserted              magic crystals from his mother’s necklace, the “spaghetti” became              powerful enough to create a talking fox.<br>              <br>              For the spell Jay should have saved up more Will Power to control              the flow of magic. But he could not delay any longer: tomorrow was              the last day of the school year and the kids had to turn their              magic wands in to the school.<br>            </div>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 3 - </td>          <td><br>          </td>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 4 -</td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </body></html>
