<p class="indent">&#x201C;Wow!&#x201D; gasped Jay.</p>
<p class="indent">The tiny man waved his hand again and a shining drawing of a Willmeter appeared on the tree&#x0027;s bark.</p>
<p class="indent">Phoebe hugged her brother. &#x201C;I think he&#x0027;s saying that you have to measure your Will Power,&#x201D; she exclaimed. &#x201C;After today&#x0027;s adventures your level will be so high that you&#x0027;ll be able to create the most beautiful wings ever, all by yourself.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Returning to Cake Island, Harold, Phoebe, Jay, and Mystie went to the Main Square to watch the Jubilant Moon Festival Parade. Ghost floats that formed and re-formed into different shapes sailed by. A flight of witches, all dressed up, followed, their brooms ablaze with multi-colored sparkles. Peacocks spread and closed their tails on command, and each time the tails had a different pattern on them.</p>
<p class="indent">Everyone came to watch the parade, Cary, Sea Dog, and the entire fire hockey team. Even Ruben and Lola were there, although just like Jay and Phoebe, they tried to be quiet and not applaud too loudly. After spending a while inside Bottomless Island their voices were squeaky and they all moved at high-speed.</p>
