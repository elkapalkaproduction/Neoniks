   <p class="indent">To sit up higher, Jay would put a fat book on his chair. It was a huge volume on medicinal plants that grew pills instead of berries. Phoebe had a brilliant idea &#x2013; if she could inspire Jay to study the book, he would leave her plate alone, at least for a while.</p>
<p class="indent">Like all Neoniks, Phoebe kept her magic in a little flask she wore around her neck. She had a tiny ball of magic left after the club session and it was just enough to create a little winged watering can that the muses called the <em>Fount of Inspiration</em>.</p>
<p class="images"><img width="50%" src="images/16_inspiration_eng.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="indent">Humming quietly, the can flew towards Jay to shed the special <em>Light of Knowledge</em> on him, but he caught it in his fist like a fly.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Careful!&#x201D; yelled Phoebe. &#x201C;You&#x0027;ll crush my Inspiration! Let it go now!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;No way!&#x201D; said Jay.</p>
                </td>
                <td width="50%" valign="middle">
               
<p class="indent">Wings sprouted behind the kids&#x2019; backs. Following Jay up to the ceiling, Phoebe began chasing him around.</p>
<p class="indent">They became so noisy that Dad came up to the room.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;What&#x0027;s going on up here?&#x201D; he asked.</p>
<p class="indent">The Fount of Inspiration shot out of Jay&#x0027;s hand, and the Light of Knowledge spilled onto Dad&#x0027;s head.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;We&#x0027;re in trouble now,&#x201D; whispered Phoebe.</p>
<p class="indent">But instead of getting mad, Dad smacked his forehead. &#x201C;I&#x0027;ve got to vacuum!&#x201D; he cried and went to deal with the mess.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;It worked!&#x201D; gasped Phoebe and hugged Jay joyously. &#x201C;My spell worked &#x2013; Dad got inspired!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">But Jay did not want to celebrate. He came down slowly, sat at his desk, and went back to his game.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;What&#x0027;s wrong?&#x201D; asked Phoebe, flying up to her brother.</p>
<p class="indent">Jay hardly ever cried, so she was really surprised when she saw that his eyes were brimming with tears. He shoved the plate with the game away, put his arms on his desk, and hid his face.</p>
