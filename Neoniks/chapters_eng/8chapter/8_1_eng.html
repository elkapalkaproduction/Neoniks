<p class="indent">Jay and Phoebe had toured Bottomless Island many times. It was a dormant volcano with a huge well in its throat. Guides said you could go down forever and ever, but admittedly, none of the tourists ever went very far down because there were plenty of interesting things right at the top.</p>
<p class="indent">On the interior slopes of Bottomless Island there were caves and terraces that housed the most incredible animals and plants. In addition, there were several underground villages, whose residents grew magic vegetable gardens and orchards.</p>
