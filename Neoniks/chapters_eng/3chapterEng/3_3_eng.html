            <p style="text-align: justify;">They became so noisy that Dad came
              up to the room.<br>
              <br>
              “What’s going on up here?” he asked.<br>
              <br>
              The Fount of Inspiration shot out of Jay’s hand, and the Light of
              Knowledge spilled onto Dad’s head. <br>
              <br>
              “We’re in trouble now,” whispered Phoebe.<br>
              <br>
              But instead of getting mad, Dad smacked his forehead. “I’ve got to
              water my plants!” he said and went out on the balcony to take care
              of his medicinal grapes that grew clusters of pills instead of
              berries.<br>
              <br>
              “It worked!” gasped Phoebe and hugged Jay joyously. “Dad doesn’t
              have any homework to do, but he was inspired to do chores!”<br>
              <br>
              But Jay did not want to celebrate. He came down slowly, sat at his
              desk, and went back to his game. <br>
              <br>
              “What’s wrong?” asked Phoebe, flying up to her brother.</p>
