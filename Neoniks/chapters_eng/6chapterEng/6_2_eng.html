But            he didn’t get any awards at all.”&nbsp;</td>          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>          <td valign="middle" width="50%">            <div style="text-align: justify;">“Why not?” wondered Phoebe. “He is              very talented.”<br>              <br>              “Two years ago he put a spell on an actress. She was performing a              very tricky number and she almost crashed. So Justacreep was              stripped of his magic powers and now no theater wants anything to              do with him.”<br>              <br>              Phoebe and Jay looked at each other.<br>              <br>              “Do you know where we can find him?” asked Jay.<br>              <br>              “I heard that he now works in a locker room at the Ice Stadium,”              said Harold. “He sharpens claws for the fire hockey players.
