<p class="chap1"><strong>SEA DOG</strong></p>
<p class="indent">Sea Dog lived at the top of Cake Island in a building that looked like a lighthouse.</p>
<p class="images"><img width="50%" src="images/21_lighthouse.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="indent">Phoebe and Jay heard his dreary howl a long way off.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;I don&#x0027;t think your teacher is well at all,&#x201D; said Phoebe. &#x201C;Maybe we should call the doctor?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">They knocked, but no one answered.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Looks like the door&#x0027;s open,&#x201D; said Jay, pushing at it.</p>

                </td>
                <td width="50%" valign="middle">
              
              <p class="indent">The howl was cut off and they saw Sea Dog sitting on the steps of the spiral stairs, his paws tied to the railing behind his back.</p>
              <p class="indent">The kids rushed to him and set him free.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;What happened here?&#x201D; asked Jay.</p>
<p class="indent">Sea Dog looked away in embarrassment.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Yesterday the pirates attacked me and I fought them valiantly. But unfortunately, they won, so I couldn&#x0027;t make it to school.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">When Sea Dog told his stories, he often got carried away and began making things up. Knowing this habit of his, he always wore his <em>Conscience</em> badge, which did not let him spin too long a yarn.</p>
<p class="indent">As soon as he mentioned pirates, the badge on his chest turned red and began flashing lights that looked like the ones on police cars.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Fine, fine,&#x201D; growled Sea Dog. &#x201C;I&#x0027;ll admit it!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">He took a tiny bubble wand from his pocket, dipped it into his flask of magic, and blew a bubble.</p>
