What else does a plain fur coat dare dream about?”<br>            <br>            Wanda’s eyes lit up. “I’ll need a diamond necklace then!” she            exclaimed as she pulled Mystie off over her head and threw her on            the floor. “I won’t have to wear this old skin anymore! It’s so            cheesy!”<br>            <br>            While Justacreep and Wanda discussed their glamorous plans, Jay            stuck his hand under the seat and reached Mystie. None of the            villains noticed him take the little fox away.<br>            <br>            He freed her paws, and Phoebe took the piggy amulet off her neck and            handed it to Mystie. “Here, hold on to this tracking device and try            to run away as soon as we land. We can use it to find you later.”<br>          </td>          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>          <td style="text-align: justify;" valign="middle" width="50%">Mystie            nodded and hid the amulet in her mouth.<br>            <br>            Jay touched Phoebe’s elbow and pointed to the magic tree. A window            in one of the painted houses opened, and a tiny ball of magic flew            out of it.<br>            <br>            Phoebe picked it up off the floor.<br>            <br>            “It’s too small,” whispered Jay, aggrieved. “We can’t do anything            with it.”<br>            <br>            “I’ve got an idea!” said Phoebe.<br>            <br>            She took the ball and, making a winged watering can, sent it back to            the tree. After the Light of Knowledge was shed on it, its heart            beat stronger, and soon its people pulled a double ball of magic            outside their house and sent it along the path. Another, smaller one            followed.</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 155 - </td>          <td><br>          </td>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 156 - </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </body></html>
