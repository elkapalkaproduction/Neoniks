<p class="chap1"><strong>HAROLD THE DRAGON</strong> </p>
<p class="indent">After Sea Dog went home, Phoebe and Jay stayed at the school entrance for a long time trying to think of what to do next.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;We have only one clue,&#x201D; said Phoebe. &#x201C;If Mr. Justacreep is such a fine actor, other actors might know about him too.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Or billposters,&#x201D; said Jay and pointed to a young dragon who was posting a new playbill on the wall of a building across the street.</p>
<p class="images"><img width="50%" src="images/26_harold_poster.jpg" alt=""/></p>
                </td>
                <td width="50%" valign="middle">
           <p class="indent">The playbill announced that, in honor of the Jubilant Moon Festival, Oversea Money Dwarves would perform popular melodies by jingling gold coins hidden in their purses.</p>
<p class="indent">The wind was pretty strong and the dragon had trouble spreading out the poster &#x2013; it kept getting away from him and rolling over his head.</p>
<p class="indent">Phoebe and Jay flew up and helped him stretch it out.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Thank you!&#x201D; said the dragon. &#x201C;If I could fly, I could manage it myself, but I have no wings. By the way, my name&#x0027;s Harold. What are your names?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Phoebe and Jay introduced themselves and asked if he&#x0027;d ever seen a poster for an actor called Justacreep.</p>
<p class="indent">Harold looked at them in amazement. &#x201C;What do you want it for?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;We don&#x0027;t want the poster; we want Mr. Justacreep,&#x201D; explained Jay and told the dragon about Mystie&#x0027;s kidnapping.</p>
