His coat-skirts wrapped themselves around the              legs and turned into strong, clawed paws; the sleeves lengthened              and flexed their muscles. The face smoothed out, the eyes and              mouth came to their right places, and Furcoat sent forth a              triumphant roar. Only his chest remained bare, with its yellow              ribs visible inside the open collar.<br>              <br>              “You lied to us!” babbled Justacreep. “You wanted to get enough              magic to make yourself a new body!
