                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;My name is Mr. Justacreep,&#x201D; said the teacher without even saying hello.The kids looked at him curiously, but he only frowned and wrinkled his nose, as if he were disgusted to be in a classroom.&#x201C;Did you see his magic wand?&#x201D; whispered Beppo, turning to Jay.It was truly amazing: on one end it had an intricately carved handle and on the other &#x2013; a fancy cup with a tiny girl who sat in it waist-deep. There was no doubt that it was a wand of the best quality.</p>
