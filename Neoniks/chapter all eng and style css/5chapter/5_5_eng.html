<p class="indent">&#x201C;It looks like Justacreep took the demonite rock,&#x201D; said Jay and turned to Sea Dog. &#x201C;What&#x0027;s so special about it?&#x201D;</p>

<p class="indent">&#x201C;Demonite destroys magic,&#x201D; replied the teacher. &#x201C;If a rock like that would touch you or your sister, you&#x0027;d lose all the spells cast on you. As for magic creatures, they could lose consciousness for a long time.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;That&#x0027;s why Mystie passed out!&#x201D; cried Jay. &#x201C;Mr. Justacreep must have touched her with this thing.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;He&#x0027;s really cruel to torture your fox!&#x201D; said Phoebe. &#x201C;We must save her!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;If I knew how to help you, I gladly would,&#x201D; said Sea Dog. &#x201C;But I have no idea where to begin.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Maybe we should call the police and tell them that Mr. Justacreep robbed the school museum?&#x201D; asked Jay hopefully.</p>
<p class="indent">But Sea Dog shook his head. &#x201C;Demonite has no value &#x2013; it destroys magic, the most important thing in the Magic World. If I call the police and ask them to bring back demonite, they&#x0027;ll think I am crazy. We keep it here, at the museum, just for display.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Jay sighed. It was true: calling the police about lost demonite was like complaining about garbage stolen from a trashcan.</p>
