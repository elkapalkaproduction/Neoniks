<p class="indent">Mystie finally freed herself from Wanda&#x0027;s fingers. &#x201C;They stole me!&#x201D; she yelled. &#x201C;Don&#x0027;t trust them! They are thieves!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Lola turned around looking for her staff, but it had disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">Just then the door flew open, and Jay, Phoebe, and Harold ran into the hothouse.</p>
<p class="indent">Jay took Mystie away from Wanda. &#x201C;Don&#x0027;t you dare touch my fox!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Lola took out a large ball of magic and was about to cast an anti-thief spell, but Justacreep took off Furcoat and managed to cover Jay and Phoebe with it.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Give us all the magic you&#x0027;ve got!&#x201D; said Furcoat to Lola. &#x201C;Otherwise I&#x0027;ll smother these brats.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Harold snorted, trying to breathe fire, but only managed to muster some old soot; he had not used his fire-breath in a very long time.</p>
<p class="indent">Wanda, who was glowing with magic, bounded up to him. &#x201C;I&#x0027;ll kiss you to death!&#x201D; she hissed, slowly advancing on Harold.</p>

                    <p class="indent">She was small, but she looked so fierce, that Harold choked on the fire he was about to breathe.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Justacreep took away Lola&#x0027;s flask with magic balls and locked her and Harold in a port-a-john.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;We&#x0027;ll take the kids hostage,&#x201D; Furcoat told them. &#x201C;If you try to chase us, we&#x0027;ll make them breathe demonite powder and they&#x0027;ll lose their magic abilities forever.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">He ordered Justacreep to take the tray with the magic tree that had the largest heart and three painted houses on its trunk. &#x201C;We won&#x0027;t be greedy,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;One tree is enough.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">Wanda put Mystie on her neck again, and Furcoat took Phoebe and Jay with them to the submarine. They all climbed into it, and Justacreep started the engine.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Be quiet!&#x201D; he told the kids who crouched behind his seat. &#x201C;And maybe we&#x0027;ll let you go back to your mommy&#x2026; in about three years.&#x201D;</p>
