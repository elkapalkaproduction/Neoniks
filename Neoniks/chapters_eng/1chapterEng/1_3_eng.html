Jay should have been asleep hours ago, but he was            sitting on the bed in his pajamas and watching the cuckoo clock.            When the hour hand got close to twelve, he perched his magic-working            goggles on his nose, picked up the “spaghetti”, and said the            activating spell:<br>            <br>            “Light-Drawing class, Chapter fifteen, Problem six.” <br>            <br>            The magic wand immediately turned into a fat pencil with a shining            lead.<br>            <br>            Moving away the bed rug, Jay sketched out a fox on the floor. He was            so nervous that luminous wings flared up behind his back from time            to time and he had to use his Will Power to black them out. What if            it runs out before I complete the ritual? Jay thought, agitated. <br>            <br>            He had already tried to create a talking fox without saving up            enough Will Power, and he got a white woolen sock instead. It was            completely clueless and hid under the bed right away. Whenever            anyone tried to touch it, the sock puffed itself up and hissed            spitefully <br>            <br>            On the second try, Jay did not have enough magic and he came up with            a sock again, this one a bit smaller. The socks made friends, ran            away from home, and made a nest in a rock crack. Soon they had            children – three balls of white yarn.</td>          <td style="width: 16px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>          <td style="width: 521.45px;" valign="middle">            <div style="text-align: center;">              <div style="text-align: left;"><br>              </div>              <img style="width: 296px; height: 320px;" alt="" src="images/05_homework.jpg"><br>            </div>            <div style="text-align: center;"> <span style="font-style: italic;"><br>                Neoniks carry magic balls around in little flasks</span></div>            <br>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 5 - </td>          <td><br>          </td>          <td align="center" height="1%"> - 6 -</td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </body></html>
