He was a guard at            the Border of Darkness and he tried to steal magic from the            plantation. But the alarm went off and he was hit by lightning. He            wasn’t lucky and the healers could only save his skin. That’s how he            became a leoman fur coat.”<br>            <br>            “Did you know that he is back on Bottomless Island?” Phoebe asked            anxiously. <br>            <br>            “He’s got friends now and they’re up to something. Maybe they            decided to steal the fireworks magic.”</td>          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>          <td style="text-align: justify;" valign="middle" width="50%">“You            think it’s that easy?” smiled Ruben. “If any magic creature or thing            touches that flower, it will explode and paralyze everyone with even            an ounce of magic.”<br>            <br>            Phoebe felt better. “It’s a good thing you are so cautious,” she            said.<br>            <br>            Suddenly there was a great crash, and a bright flare lit up the            inside of Bottomless Island. <br>            <br>            Phoebe fell to the ground and covered her head with her hands. She            expected everyone to run around screaming, but instead there was            absolute silence. She raised her head and gasped – leomen stood            still as statues, the magic flower disappeared, and the Star Fairies            were frozen in the air in a petrified fairy-circle.<br>            <br>            “Ruben!” yelled Phoebe, but there was no answer.&nbsp;</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 127 - </td>          <td><br>          </td>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 128 - </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </body></html>
