<p class="indent">&#x201C;Where do I go now?&#x201D; asked Phoebe.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Forward!&#x201D; replied Jay.</p>
<p class="indent">Phoebe pulled the handlebars, Sky Scooter jerked, and she hit a wet sheet that was hanging out on the clothesline.</p>
<p class="indent">Phoebe fell off the Sky Scooter, and the last thing that Jay heard was her yell of &#x201C;Mo-o-mmy!&#x201D; that was getting fainter and fainter.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;She&#x0027;ll crash!&#x201D; gasped Jay, looking at the glowing dot on the map that was falling into the chasm.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;She&#x0027;ll be fine,&#x201D; said Zoe confidently. &#x201C;The thick green air won&#x0027;t let her crash &#x2013; everything moves too slowly down there.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">A very out-of-breath Harold ran up to them. &#x201C;I&#x0027;m done with all the playbills and thought I&#x0027;d come back to help,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I was worried sick about you.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Phoebe fell off the Sky Scooter!&#x201D; cried Jay. &#x201C;Please come with me to Bottomless Island! We have to save her!&#x201D;</p>

                    <p class="indent">Harold and Jay climbed aboard the banana and went off towards Bottomless Island.</p>
