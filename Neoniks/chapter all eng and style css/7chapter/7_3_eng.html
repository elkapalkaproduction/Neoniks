<p class="indent">&#x201C;Unfortunately, our fox has fleas and I am afraid you might catch them,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;It&#x0027;s my mother&#x0027;s pet and she asked me to take it to the vet.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Oh well,&#x201D; the dragon sighed and rose. &#x201C;Time to go play. We&#x0027;ve got an important game today.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">The dragons went into a huddle, stomped their paws, and rattled their armor.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Muscles</em> &#x2013; <em>a ton!</em> </p>
<p class="indent"><em>Claws made to stun!</em></p>
<p class="indent"><em>Winning on the run</em>,</p>
<p class="indent"><em>We&#x0027;re afraid of none!</em></p>
<p class="indent">Mystie could call for help till she was hoarse &#x2013; no one would have heard her in the din.</p>
<p class="indent">When the dragons ran out of the room, Justacreep said to Mystie, &#x201C;If you try to run away again, I&#x0027;ll put demonite in the cup with you.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">The little fox shrank away in fear; she figured that Justacreep would do any dirty trick to get his way.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Have the fire hockey players left?&#x201D; Furcoat&#x0027;s voice sounded hollow.</p>
<p class="indent">All this time he and Wanda had been hidden in one of the metal lockers.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Take us out!&#x201D; yelled the magic wand. &#x201C;It&#x0027;s stuffy in here and Furcoat smells of dog!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Justacreep opened the door and took them out.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Where&#x0027;s the demonite?&#x201D; asked Furcoat.</p>

                </td>
                <td width="50%" valign="middle">
      <p class="indent">Justacreep patted his chest. &#x201C;Right here, in a bag in my breast pocket.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Then hurry up and put me on &#x2013; I am starving without your heat! Be careful though. Unlike you, Wanda and I are magical creatures and we can&#x0027;t touch demonite.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Justacreep pulled Furcoat on and shoved Wanda into the buttonhole. &#x201C;I guess we&#x0027;ll be going to Bottomless Island now. We&#x0027;ve got plenty of lacegrass and demonite. Are we taking the fox?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Sure,&#x201D; said Furcoat. &#x201C;It&#x0027;ll come in handy.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Mystie was even more scared. She felt Justacreep picking up her cup, and whined quietly with fear.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Hello,&#x201D; said an unfamiliar voice with a dragon accent. &#x201C;Where do you sharpen claws here?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;And who are you?&#x201D; asked Justacreep suspiciously.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;An athlete,&#x201D; replied the dragon. &#x201C;My name&#x0027;s Harold the Unbeatable.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;You&#x0027;re too young to be &#x2018;the Unbeatable&#x2019;,&#x201D; grumbled Justacreep and put the cup back on the table. &#x201C;Oh, well, let&#x0027;s see your claws here.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Mystie couldn&#x0027;t decide what to do. Should she yell? But what if Justacreep followed up on his threat? </p>
