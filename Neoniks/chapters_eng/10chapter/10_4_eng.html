                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;You think it&#x0027;s that easy?&#x201D; smiled Ruben. &#x201C;If any magic creature or thing touches that flower, it will explode and paralyze everyone with even an ounce of magic.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">Phoebe felt better. &#x201C;It&#x0027;s a good thing you are so cautious,&#x201D; she said.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Suddenly there was a great crash, and a bright flare lit up the inside of Bottomless Island.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Phoebe fell to the ground and covered her head with her hands. She expected everyone to run around screaming, but instead there was absolute silence. She raised her head and gasped &#x2013; leomen stood still as statues, the magic flower disappeared, and the Star Fairies were frozen in the air in a petrified fairy-circle.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Ruben!&#x201D; yelled Phoebe, but there was no answer.</p>

<p class="indent">She realized that leomen were magical creatures and they were paralyzed by the explosion of the starry flower. Nothing happened to Phoebe because she had no magic left after she was touched by demonite.</p>
<p class="indent">There was a sound of hollow chugging, and Phoebe saw a demonite-covered submarine going down. When it drew level with her, a hatch opened and Justacreep looked out, Wanda at his side.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Hey, missy, did you see our cannon hit the magic flower?&#x201D; he yelled. &#x201C;Too bad you didn&#x0027;t have any magic in you; you would&#x0027;ve made a lovely statue.&#x201D;</p>
