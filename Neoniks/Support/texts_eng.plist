And that is exactly what it is called: Cake Island.Magical people called Neoniks live on that island. Using magic, the Neoniks can not only fly, but also perform miracles. For example, they can change the weather above their homes or make magic utensils that entertain the little ones during dinner. Especially powerful magicians can create new types of animals or plants. </string>	<key>10</key>	<string>In Waterfall Performance Center, the streams of water work as curtains, and on performance days they move aside unveiling the huge stage behind them. The audience gathers by the shore and watches jolly comedies performed by mermaids, mermen, and brave divers.</string>	<key>11</key>	<string>Neoniks’ Will Power is an ability to perform miracles. Only those who have a lot of Will Power can do magic. Neoniks have to train their Will Power all the time, or it will grow weaker. For example, keeping promises or reaching the goals boost its level in a tremendous way.Will Power is measured by a special device called a Willmeter.</string>	<key>12</key>	<string>The dome of The Soap Bubble Theater is iridescent during the day and crystal clear at night, allowing the moonlight to come through the roof. The theater boasts with air-floating seats that look like soap bubbles you can comfortably sit on. Kids love riding them and ramming into one another.Actors and musicians from far-off lands often perform at The Soap Bubble Theater. For example, the Forest Trolls Chorale and Money Dwarves, who perform popular melodies jingling them with the silver and gold coins hidden in their purses, give annual shows that are always a great success.</string>	<key>13</key>	<string>Both kids and adults like to come to the famous Doughnut Cafe because there is no other place where you could find such delicious treats as Sweet Dreams, Hot Topics, and Sparkling Water-Under-the-Bridge. These are the Neoniks’ favorite dishes.Inside the café, the walls are papered with enlarged pages from children’s books, the chairs look like powder-boxes with the most delicate powder-puffs for seats, and the transparent tables create a nice illusion – the customers’ legs look exceptionally slender under them, even those of Madame Hippo.</string>	<key>14</key>	<string>Neonik School look like a lot of multi-colored birdhouses connected by suspension bridges and ropes. The classrooms there are also unusual; instead of desks they are filled with cozy nests suspended from the ceiling.Neonik School has a museum displaying Track Pathetics Cups, the retorts with children’s dreams, and a tank of miniature whales.</string>	<key>15</key>	<string>The Neoniks love to build unusual houses, often in shapes of various objects. Book shaped, toaster shaped, bottle shaped houses and even a contrabass shaped skyscraper can be found on Cake Island. The Jay family lives in the house shown in the picture. You can get inside either through the passageway carved in the cliff or through the chimney. Naturally, the Jays’ children always choose the chimney, because when you fly from school you don't feel like going a long way round. </string>	<key>16</key>	<string>If the Neoniks want to fly somewhere within an easy reach, they use their own magical wings. But long distance travels require buying expensive teleportation tickets. The Neoniks ride boats, Sky Scooters and air traffic dragons as well. The tourists arrive at Cake Island at Magic Broom Airport. It has runways suitable for all kinds of magical vehicles ranging from flying cargo-carpets to privately owned enchanted forks and spoons. </string>	<key>17</key>	<string>Phoebe is 10-years-old fifth grader. She dreams of becoming a Muse who inspires artists and poets to create new artworks. In order to do that, she studies the basics of inspiration in the Little Muse Club.Phoebe wears a silk dress, hooded jacket, and flowery safety goggles to work with magic. </string>	<key>18</key>	<string>An 8-years-old Jay adores his cool safety goggles. They have invisible temples and make him look like a super-hero from the Knight on the Broom TV series.  Jay tries to be just as strong, brave, and sharp-witted.He prefers wearing his magic-containing pendant on the wrist and rolls the magic balls out so smoothly even the school principal admires him.Jay’s Will Power is developed beyond his age because he is a responsible person. It is important to him that his friends and relatives are okay and he always takes care of them, even though no one expects it. After all, he is just a little boy. </string>	<key>19</key>	<string>Neoniks are the magical people who live on Cake Island. When they turn seven, a wizard casts the Winged Spell on them and then the little ones learn to grow wings instantly when they need them.At first the Neoniks kids are not very good at magic and can only make very simple wings; but the adults can sometimes grow really magnificent wings that sparkle with neon lights.</string>	<key>2</key>	<string>There's a lighthouse on the top of Cake Island, whose outlines resemble a chess piece. Sea Dog lives there, an old school teacher, who used to be a captain on a big ship. When Sea Dog tells his stories, he often gets carried away and begins making things up. Knowing this habit of his, he always wears his Medal for Conscience that does not let him spin too long a yarn. Should he tell a fib, the Medal starts flashing like police car emergency lights.</string>	<key>20</key>	<string>This flying saucer has crashed at Cake Island, but the aliens loves the island so much that have decided to stay.They organized a nightclub inside their spacecraft and since then amuse Neoniks playing the most incredible musical instruments at their parties. They quickly rub bottles with their sticky fingers, or pound the balls against the wall, or play a huge accordion whose bellows have to be expanded by six musicians.The Neoniks dance flying up high to the ceiling, and colorful rays of light beam through all observation windows of the flying saucer.</string>	<key>21</key>	<string>Once upon a time, Cake Island was inhabited by now extinct iron demons. There is no accurate information about them; however, occasionally Neoniks come across their abandoned armor. The unusual demonite stones that destroy magic are always found nearby.If Neoniks touch a demonite, all spells they bear will be broken, including those allowing them to fly. A magical creature, such as Wristie the Fox, can lose consciousness by touching a demonite.</string>	<key>22</key>	<string>The Foam Castle is situated in the middle of the Sparkling Sea. From a far, it looks like it's made of millions of tiny bubbles. The magical beauties, the Muses, who come fly to poets and artists to inspire them for new masterpieces, live in the Castle. An encounter with a Muse flying her own way is considered a great luck.</string>	<key>23</key>	<string>Bottomless Island is a dormant volcano whose throat housed a huge well. Guides say you could go down forever and ever, but admittedly, none of the tourists ever went very far down because there were plenty of interesting things right at the top.Inside, Bottomless Island is filled with a special greenish air that is heavier and thicker than regular air, and those who spend some time there get used to applying more effort to do everything. When they come out they move at higher speed and speak in high cartoonish voices for a while.On the interior slopes of Bottomless Island there are caves and terraces which house the most incredible animals and plants. In addition, there are several underground villages, whose residents grow magic vegetable gardens and orchards.</string>	<key>24</key>	<string>Story and ideas – Elle Vira        Translation – Natasha LibermanArt – Tamara GerasunProgramming – Andrei VidrascoProducer – Pavel Mamaev</string>	<key>25</key>	<string>Chapter 1.

He can run very fast but that skill does not impress his family very much. He has two brothers, and their mother always points them out as an example for Harald. The elder brother works as a fiery dragon at a factory and spends his days dancing on coals in a furnace. The middle brother had learned how to breathe a stream of firefighting foam instead of fire and works as a firefighter.Harald dreams to be a test pilot, but he hasn't managed to save enough magic to get his wings. On Cake Island, dragons grow the wings without using magic only when they fall in love.</string>	<key>27</key>	<string>There was time when Justpuss was a promising actor. One day he bewitched an actress out of envy and she was close to losing her life, while performing a difficult stunt. Justpuss was deprived of his magical power as punishment, and since then not a single theater wants to deal with him. Now he works in a locker room of the Ice Stadium and sharpens dragons claws. </string>	<key>28</key>	<string>Magie supposed to be a top class magic wand, but she was expelled from Magic Wand College for poor progress, and now she can do very few magic tricks.Yet her appearance is quite impressive. Her handle is covered with fancy carving, and the cup she’s sitting in glows with blue light. Magie dreams of becoming a wand-a-girl for other magic wands to be jealous, burst with envy, and turn into magic splinters.</string>	<key>3</key>	<string>Lacegrass is a very rare and fussy plant. Its leaves and petals bear a lacework resemblance. Gardeners from all over the Magic World compete trying to grow a flower with the coolest pattern.An owner must feed his or her Lacegrass with cookie crumbs, spray it with perfume, and praise daily. Otherwise, it'll raise a stink and shrivel with disappointment.</string>	<key>4</key>	<string>Ice Stadium is where dragon fire hockey games take place. It is not only the most spectacular but also the most dangerous sport on Cake Island. During the game the dragons skate on ice on sharpened claws with great speed, wearing safety helmets, armor, and kneepads.Part of the team is made up of fire-breathing dragons who melt the ice in front of their opponents coming on with the puck. If they do it well, the forward would fall flat on his nose in the mud. But it isn’t that easy to stop him because frost-breathing dragons always follow him. They try to make an ice slide for him, so that the forward would be able to get to the post and score a goal with his tail.</string>	<key>5</key>	<string>Crazy Cactuses grow in the burning hot Brickoven Desert. They communicate with each other using sign language, moving their branches and trunks, sometimes in quite a rude way. When blossoming, they get into a singing mood and blare bandit ditties that could be heard miles away.Crazy Cactuses have a very odd sense of humor. They like throwing big thorny balls at occasional travelers. When they hit their targets, they roar with laughter.</string>	<key>6</key>	<string>The Unnatural History Museum is located in the Sand Castle, built of quicksand. Its towers constantly change their outlines and the Castle itself may crawl to a different spot. The Museum is famous for its ghost gallery of nearly all magical creatures and a vast collection of magical items. The centerpiece treasure of the Museum is the small Dimensionless Purse, which you can keep packing forever. It’s another magical world's portal and everything you put into it ends up there. </string>	<key>7</key>	<string>Like other magical creatures Wristie the Fox was created by magic. Her owner, 8-year-old Jay, reached the final level of a magical game and won the first prize, a spell allowing him to create a talking supernatural creature The fox is so tiny she can wrap herself around Jay’s wrist like a bracelet, that’s he calls her Wristie. She has a magical crystal on her forehead, and each time she feels happy, a wave of purple light is running through her soft fur. </string>	<key>8</key>	<string>The currency of Cake Island is magic that comes in different size balls. Neoniks carry it in little flask pendants and use it for their personal needs or exchange it for  anything starting with ice cream and all the way up to a magic castle. Magic balls could be frozen and kept in the bank in the Village of Snow Queens. Under low temperatures, the balls accumulate the so called interests, which is tiny drops of magic that gradually increase the ball's value and power.The manufacturing technology of magic balls is a top secret.</string>	<key>9</key>	<string>Once upon a time there was a Miner who lived on Cake Island and who found enormous reserves of magic underground. He never separated with his rat that warned him of coming rockslides and gas leaks. The rat was the Miner’s only friend, but he began to suspect that it wanted to steal his magic, and chased it away, just in case. His greed exhausted him so much that his body shriveled and he turned into a skeleton that had neither a heart nor a brain, and he couldn’t use his magic wealth anymore. Ever since then, the Greedy Miner is wandering around the island and pestering passersby at night, demanding that they return his rat. If you talk to him, he will follow you home and moan under your window, ‘Where is my darling rat?’</string></dict></plist>
