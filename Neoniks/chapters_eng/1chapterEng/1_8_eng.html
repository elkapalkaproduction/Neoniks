My father is a surgeon at the            hospital and he is on night duty today, so Rusty’s afraid of his own            shadow. Let’s play, but we have to be quiet. They can’t find out            about you or I’ll be in a lot of trouble.”<br>            <br>            The fox nodded and began tickling Jay with her fluffy tail. They            played for a long time, trying not to laugh too loudly; then they            talked and Jay told her about himself and about other Neoniks who            lived on Cake Island.<br>            <br>            “I’ll show you around,” he promised. “Our island really does look            like a cake with several layers – a large one with the smaller ones            on top of each other. If you look at it from above, the beaches and            the forest look like icing, and the houses – like candied fruit and            nuts.”<br>            <br>            The fox wrapped herself around Jay’s wrist like a bracelet, and a            wave of violet light went over her soft fur. Jay noticed this            happening every time she was happy.&nbsp;</td>          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>          <td valign="middle" width="50%">            <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 294px; height: 354px;"                src="images/08_mystie_on_the_wrist.jpg"                alt=""><br>              <br>              <span style="font-style: italic;">Mystie the Fox</span><br>            </div>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 15 - </td>          <td><br>          </td>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%">- 16 -</td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </body></html>
