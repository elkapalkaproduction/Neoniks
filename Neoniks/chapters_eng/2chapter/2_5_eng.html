                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Well, are you scared?&#x201D; shrieked Wanda in a dreadful voice.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;No,&#x201D; said the kids.</p>
                    <p class="indent">They had all known the story of the Greedy Miner since their kindergarten days. Moreover, many of them had met him: so there was a skeleton who wandered the streets and moaned. So what?</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;I don&#x0027;t think Wanda&#x0027;s a real teacher,&#x201D; whispered Beppo to Jay. &#x201C;She doesn&#x0027;t know how to deal with kids.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Yeah, and Mr. Justacreep is pretty strange, too,&#x201D; agreed Jay. &#x201C;I wonder where he&#x0027;s gone to.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">He had decided to show Mystie during recess, but he was so bored with Wanda&#x0027;s &#x201C;lesson&#x201D; that he could not take it anymore.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Beppo, I won a magic fox,&#x201D; he said quietly.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;No way!&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">Beppo also liked to play video games and he often competed with Jay on who could reach the last level first.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Look!&#x201D; said Jay and pulled Mystie out of his backpack.</p>

                    <p class="indent">The fox was so happy to be out of the stuffy backpack that a wave of violet light ran down her fur.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Wanda noticed it right away. &#x201C;What&#x0027;s that?&#x201D; she shrieked. &#x201C;A toy?&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">Mystie dived inside Jay&#x0027;s jacket.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;No, it&#x0027;s a magic fox,&#x201D; he said nervously.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The kids clamored round: &#x201C;Wow, really?&#x201D; &#x201C;Let me see!&#x201D; &#x201C;Ple-a-a-se!&#x201D;</p>
