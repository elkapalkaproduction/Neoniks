That way you could look at them from the outside and            decide what to do next. The inhabitants of Cake Island called that            “to face the facts”.<br>            <br>            Sea Dog’s bubble spun in the air for a moment and then turned into a            pink figure in a top hat.<br>            <br>            “That’s Mr. Justacreep!” cried Jay, amazed.<br>            <br>            Sea Dog’s ears flopped down.<br>            <br>            “Yesterday morning I had a visit from a man in a top hat and a fur            coat,” he admitted. “The man introduced himself as a member of the            Moral Standards Society and he said that he admired my exploits very            much. He asked for permission to tell about them in his book            entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">Heroes Among Us</span>            and I let him into the house.”<br>            <br>            Sea Dog made another bubble that turned into his own pink image.</td>          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>          <td style="text-align: justify;" valign="middle" width="50%">“Oh, my!”            squeaked miniature Justacreep. “I’m going to die of admiration! You            are not just a hero; you are an Educator with a capital E! I must            give you my dearest possession – my fur coat.” <br>            <br>            “My own skin’s warm enough,” the little Sea Dog said, but little            Justacreep would not listen.<br>            <br>            “Oh, no, you must try it on! You can’t even imagine how well the            collar goes with your face!”<br>            <br>            But as soon as the little Sea Dog put on little Justacreep’s fur            coat, it squeezed him so hard that he couldn’t even move his tail.<br>            <br>            The big Sea Dog sighed heavily and popped the bubbles.<br>            <br>            “I didn’t realize that the fur coat was alive,” said the old            teacher. “And it, or rather he, is probably the one who is in charge            of Justacreep. The fur coat told him to search my pockets and take            away the key to the school museum.”</td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 61 - </td>          <td><br>          </td>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 62 - </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </body></html>
