<p class="indent">&#x201C;You lied to us!&#x201D; babbled Justacreep. &#x201C;You wanted to get enough magic to make yourself a new body! You didn&#x0027;t need a tree!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Of course I needed the tree!&#x201D; growled Furcoat. &#x201C;If I have a magic heart, <em>I</em> will be a source of magic!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">He tried to claw the heart off the tree, but Mystie pulled her amulet out of her mouth and threw it in between Furcoat&#x0027;s ribs.</p>
<p class="images"><img src="images/59_mystie_throws.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="indent">Immediately, his chest grew muscles and was covered with a thick fur.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Oink, oink!&#x201D; came from deep within Furcoat&#x0027;s body.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;What have you done?&#x201D; Furcoat roared furiously.He chased Mystie around the cave, breaking </p>

             <td width="50%" valign="middle">


<p class="indent">stalactites and stalagmites on his way. Several times he knocked Justacreep down, running past him.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Don&#x0027;t touch me!&#x201D; yelled Justacreep, grabbing the toilet brush and brandishing it like a sword.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally Furcoat chased Mystie into a corner. &#x201C;I got you now, you little shrimp,&#x201D; he growled and got ready to squash her with his fist.</p>
<p class="indent">Just then the gates crashed open and a herd of crocorhines barged into the cave. They ran into the submarine by the entrance and demonite flew off it all over the cave.</p>
<p class="indent">In terror, Mystie covered her head with her paws but fortunately none of the rocks hit her. Furcoat managed to avoid demonite by jumping behind a pile of stones; the crocorhines that were touched by it passed out, while the rest ran away howling.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Some sleeping beauties!&#x201D; said Jay as he flew into the cave.</p>
<p class="indent">Phoebe was sitting on his shoulders and holding the glowing map in front of her.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Mystie must be here somewhere!&#x201D; she cried pointing to the blinking dot. &#x201C;We were right to bring the crocorhines here and make them gate-crash!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Watch out!&#x201D; yelled Mystie.</p>
