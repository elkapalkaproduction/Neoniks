<p class="indent">Phoebe screamed as she fell and desperately tried to grab on to something.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Help!&#x201D; she yelled, tumbling through the air.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Gotcha!&#x201D; Phoebe heard a bass voice and found herself held by a creature covered in short golden fur. It was a leoman &#x2013; a man with a lion&#x0027;s head, a thick mane, and a slim, muscular body.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Are you all right?&#x201D; he asked Phoebe after setting her down on the ground.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Yes. Thank you!&#x201D; she panted.</p>

                <td width="50%" valign="middle">
                    <p class="indent">Other leomen gathered round. They told Phoebe that she was in an underground town called Leoville, set on an interior ledge of Bottomless Island.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Leomen lived in houses that looked like stacks of children&#x0027;s blocks. Sunlight could not reach this far down, so the streets of Leoville were full of lanterns and numerous signs that were ablaze with light and advertised all sorts of nonsense: &#x201C;This is a Fence&#x201D; or &#x201C;Here is a Comfortable Bench.&#x201D; Phoebe even noticed a sign that said &#x201C;Nothing Ever Happens Here.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">Leomen kids drove around town on bikes with sparkling wheels. Instead of trees there were dandelions as tall as palm trees, with filaments that shone in the gloom.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The leoman that saved Phoebe introduced himself. &#x201C;My name&#x0027;s Ruben, what&#x0027;s yours?&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;I&#x0027;m Phoebe,&#x201D; she replied. &#x201C;I wanted to help my little brother save his fox &#x2013; she was stolen by an evil teacher. But I fell off the Sky Scooter and got lost. I have to get back to the top; Jay will be worried.&#x201D;</p>
