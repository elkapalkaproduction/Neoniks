<p class="indent">&#x201C;It&#x0027;s the Greedy Miner!&#x201D; shrieked Justacreep.</p>
<p class="indent">The skeleton turned his head and moaned, chattering his yellow teeth, &#x201C;Where is my rat?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Give him the fox!&#x201D; said Furcoat to Justacreep. &#x201C;He can&#x0027;t tell the difference. It just has to be a small magical creature!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">The skeleton stepped out of the magic circle and moved forward, extending his bony arms. &#x201C;Where is my ratty-matey?!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Justacreep shoved the terrified Mystie towards him.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;My dear!&#x201D; mumbled the skeleton and pressed Mystie to a spot where he used to have a cheek. &#x201C;My curse is lifted!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">He began to grow muscles and skin right in front of their eyes. The hat fell off his skull and with a clatter landed on a nearby stalagmite. His fingers fell open and the Greedy Miner let go of Mystie. Once she was on the floor, she ran to the magic tree and hid in its crown.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Furcoat, what&#x0027;s going on?&#x201D; screamed Justacreep. &#x201C;Why did you call this monster? Why did you waste so much magic on him? We wanted to grow a tree&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Shut up and do as you&#x0027;re told,&#x201D; snapped Furcoat. &#x201C;Put me on the skeleton!&#x201D;Justacreep was only too happy to get rid of him. </p>

                 <p class="indent">He watched for the right moment and then put the Miner&#x0027;s arms into the sleeves and flung Furcoat&#x0027;s face over his skull.</p>
                 <p class="indent">Furcoat began to fuse with the skeleton right away. His coat-skirts wrapped themselves around the legs and turned into strong, clawed paws; the sleeves lengthened and flexed their muscles. The face smoothed out, the eyes and mouth came to their right places, and Furcoat sent forth a triumphant roar. Only his chest remained bare, with its yellow ribs visible inside the open collar.</p>
