                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Furcoat, what&#x0027;s going on?&#x201D; screamed Justacreep. &#x201C;Why did you call this monster? Why did you waste so much magic on him? We wanted to grow a tree&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Shut up and do as you&#x0027;re told,&#x201D; snapped Furcoat. &#x201C;Put me on the skeleton!&#x201D;Justacreep was only too happy to get rid of him. </p>
                    
                    <p class="indent">He watched for the right moment and then put the Miner&#x0027;s arms into the sleeves and flung Furcoat&#x0027;s face over his skull.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Furcoat began to fuse with the skeleton right away. His coat-skirts wrapped themselves around the legs and turned into strong, clawed paws; the sleeves lengthened and flexed their muscles. The face smoothed out, the eyes and mouth came to their right places, and Furcoat sent forth a triumphant roar. Only his chest remained bare, with its yellow ribs visible inside the open collar.</p>

<p class="indent">&#x201C;You lied to us!&#x201D; babbled Justacreep. &#x201C;You wanted to get enough magic to make yourself a new body! You didn&#x0027;t need a tree!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Of course I needed the tree!&#x201D; growled Furcoat. &#x201C;If I have a magic heart, <em>I</em> will be a source of magic!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">He tried to claw the heart off the tree, but Mystie pulled her amulet out of her mouth and threw it in between Furcoat&#x0027;s ribs.</p>
