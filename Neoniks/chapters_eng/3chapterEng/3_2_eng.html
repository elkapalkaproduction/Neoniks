Just as she thought! Jay poured water              into the first bowl that came handy, added a ball of magic to it,              and created a screen for a multi-player video game.<br>              <br>              It was times like these that Phoebe wanted to send her brother to              the Brickoven Desert or some other place even further and nastier              – just so he’d know not to take other people’s things!<br>              <br>              She had a brilliant idea – what if she inspired Jay to study the              Crazy Cactuses that grew in the desert? They were very interesting              plants with quite a unique sense of humor – they threw prickly              balls at the passersby and roared with laughter if they scored a              hit. If Jay became interested in them, he’d ask their parents to              send him to the Brickoven Summer Camp.<br>              <br>              Phoebe had a tiny ball of magic left after the club session and it              was just enough to create a little winged watering can that the              muses called the Fount of Inspiration.</p>          </td>          <td style="text-align: center;" valign="middle" width="50%">            <p class="images"><img style="width: 447px; height: 315px;" src="images/16_inspiration_eng.jpg"                alt=""></p>            <p class="images"><em>The Fount of Inspiration</em></p>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%">- 41 - </td>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 42 - </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </body></html>
