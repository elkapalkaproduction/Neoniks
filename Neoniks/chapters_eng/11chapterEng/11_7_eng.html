            <p style="text-align: justify;">Half-grown trees, ready to join the
              others, stood by the greenhouse entrance. Their hearts were tiny
              and only one or two houses could fit on their bark.<br>
              <br>
              Justacreep sprinkled some demonite powder over one of the trees
              while Lola wasn’t looking. Right away its leaves turned black, as
              if burned.<br>
              <br>
              “Gosh! You’ve got plague fever here!” cried Justacreep. “It’s a
              terrible disease that can spread through the entire plantation! I
              have to take this specimen to the lab and run some tests.”<br>
              <br>
              “Poor little tree!” gasped Lola, horrified. “Are you sure it can
              be taken out of the greenhouse?”<br>
              <br>
              “That’s what I am here for,” said Justacreep.<br>
              <br>
              Mystie realized that she did not have a moment to spare. She made
              herself remember how happily she had played with Jay. It was such
              a joyful thought that a wave of violet light ran over her fur.<br>
              <br>
              Lola’s mouth fell open when she saw it. “Is this a magic fox?” she
              cried. “Did you make it yourself?”</p>
