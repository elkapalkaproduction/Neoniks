The fur coat told him to search my pockets and take away the key to the school museum.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;What did they want it for?&#x201D; asked Phoebe, astonished.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Sea Dog shrugged. &#x201C;I have no idea. But that&#x0027;s not all! After they tied me to the railing, Justacreep called the school and told them in <em>my voice</em> that I was sick and that there will be a substitute. That man is a first-class actor!&#x201D;</p>
