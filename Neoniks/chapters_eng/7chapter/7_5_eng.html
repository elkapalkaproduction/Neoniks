                    <p class="indent">The dragon turned around and saw Justacreep running towards him; he was waving Wanda as if he was going to put a dreadful spell on him.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Harold ran for it but he got lost in all the intricate stadium passages. Finally he saw a bright light at the end of the hallway. He thought it was an exit to the street and made towards it. There was a roar of the crowd, and quite suddenly Harold flew out on the ice where the fire hockey game was in full swing.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Watch out!&#x201D; yelled a huge green dragon in shining armor.</p>
                    <p class="indent">A stream of fire went past Harold&#x0027;s head, and the next moment he turned into an icicle, frozen by the frost-breath of another player.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The referee whistled and there was a great stir in the stands. Justacreep ran up to Harold and snatched the cup that held Mystie.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Help!&#x201D; the fox kept crying, but once again, no one heard her tiny voice.</p>
                    <p class="indent">When Justacreep tumbled outside, Phoebe and Jay got in his way.</p>

                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Where&#x0027;s Mystie?&#x201D; Jay demanded.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;I&#x0027;m here!&#x201D; she yelled as loud as she could.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The kids grabbed Justacreep by the lapels of his fur coat. &#x201C;Give Mystie back!&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">The animal face on the coat collar turned live and snapped its horrible teeth at them. Justacreep took a demonite rock from his breast pocket and touched first Jay and then his sister with it.</p>
                    <p class="indent">They felt as if they were struck by lightning.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;What did you do?&#x201D; screamed Jay. &#x201C;We can&#x0027;t fly now!&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;You shouldn&#x0027;t meddle in things that don&#x0027;t concern you!&#x201D; smirked Justacreep as he darted away.</p>
