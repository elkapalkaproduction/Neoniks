Some of us do maintenance, some are              agricultural engineers,” answered Ruben. “Today the Border of              Darkness will be shut down for a little while so the magic for the              fireworks can go through. If you want, you can see how it’s              raised. It’s a very beautiful sight.”<br>              <br>              “Of course I want to!” said Phoebe.<br>              <br>              Leomen brought out folding chairs and blankets and made themselves              comfortable on the edge of the chasm. While they waited for the              magic to rise, Phoebe kept looking at them and thinking that she              had seen creatures like that before. She decided to ask Ruben              whether they had met recently, but just then Leomen began clapping              excitedly.<br>              <br>              “Magic! Magic!” they cried.<br>              <br>              The gloom lessened, and Phoebe saw a field covered with twinkling              lights. It looked like a starry sky was spread out below them. The              lights gathered into a ball and it opened up like a flower of              millions of blinking stars. Fairies in shining gowns flew up to it              and carefully guided it upwards.&nbsp;</div>          </td>          <td valign="middle" width="50%"><br>            <p style="text-align: center;" class="images"><img style="width: 474px; height: 363px;"                src="images/45_rising_magic.jpg"                alt=""></p>            <p style="text-align: center;" class="images"><span style="font-style: italic;">Star
