As for magic creatures,              they could lose consciousness for a long time.”<br>              <br>              “That’s why Mystie passed out!” cried Jay. “Mr. Justacreep must              have touched her with this thing.”<br>              <br>              “He’s really cruel to torture your fox!” said Phoebe. “We must              save her!”<br>              <br>              “If I knew how to help you, I gladly would,” said Sea Dog. “But I              have no idea where to begin.”<br>              <br>              “Maybe we should call the police and tell them that Mr. Justacreep              robbed the school museum?” asked Jay hopefully.</div>          </td>          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>          <td valign="middle" width="50%">            <div style="text-align: justify;">But Sea Dog shook his head. <br>              <br>              “Demonite has no value – it destroys magic, the most important              thing in the Magic World. If I call the police and ask them to              bring back demonite, they’ll think I am crazy. We keep it here, at              the museum, just for display.” <br>              <br>              Jay sighed. It was true: calling the police about lost demonite              was like complaining about garbage stolen from a trash can.<br>              <br>            </div>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td height="1%" align="center" width="50%"> - 71 - </td>          <td><br>          </td>          <td height="1%" align="center" width="50%">- 72 -</td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </body></html>
