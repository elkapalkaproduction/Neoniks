Now he was questioning his magic              ability. After all, what kind of a magician were you if the only              thing you could make were useless socks? <br>              <br>              The minute hand moved to twelve. A little door above the clock              face opened and a cuckoo perch came out; it had a plaque attached              to it that said, “Sleeping. Do not disturb!”<br>              <br>              The drawing on the floor flared up and became a mirror, reflecting              Jay’s pale face. His fair hair was standing on end and his blue              eyes were widened, as if he had to go into a giant’s den without a              safety vest of invisibility.<br>              <br>              Jay uncorked the little flask he wore dangling from his wrist and              the bluish balls of magic floated up one after the other. Circling              a bit in the air, they dissolved in the mirrored surface and soon              enough little violet-colored lightnings played over it.<br>              <br>              Suddenly everything went out and Jay froze in despair – did              something go wrong again?</p>            <div style="text-align: center;"><br>            </div>          </td>          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>          <td style="text-align: justify;" valign="middle" width="50%">“Shalaam-balaam,”            he said in a trembling voice. The lightnings flared up again and Jay            breathed out in relief. “Abara-kadabara!” he continued to read the            magic words.<br>            <br>            To make a live creature you had to find a thousand odd words in the            reference guide and then make a spell of them. There were no            ready-made formulas for this – after all, the magician had to take            into account his own ideas, the time, the place, and the positions            of the stars in the sky. For a ten-year-old it was a nearly            impossible task.<br>            <br>            Nevertheless, when Jay finished reading the spell, there was a            brilliant whirlpool on the mirrored surface. A ray of light from the            magic want hit it, there was a gust of hot wind, and a fireball went            spinning in the air.<br>            <br>            If I get a sock this time, I’ll never do magic again, thought Jay.<br>            <br>            With a loud pop the fireball fell apart into minute sparks and a            tiny white fox with a purple gem on her forehead jumped down on the            floor.<br>            <br>            Jay picked her up and brought her to his face: “I can’t believe it…            It worked!”<br>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 7 - </td>          <td><br>          </td>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 8 -</td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </body></html>
