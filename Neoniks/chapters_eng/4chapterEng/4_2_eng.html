Cake Island was celebrating the Jubilant Moon Festival tonight            and Cary had a new hairdo with little carved roses. <br>            <br>            Phoebe and Jay noticed right away that there was something wrong –            Cary’s face was sad and she had two little wrinkle-cracks between            her eyebrows.<br>            <br>            “What’s the matter?” asked Phoebe.<br>            <br>            Cary pointed to a wide windowsill, which used to house pots of            lacegrass. It was a very rare and fussy plant that had to be fed            with cookie crumbs, sprayed with perfume, and praised daily.<br>          </td>          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>          <td valign="middle" width="50%">            <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 341px; height: 313px;"                src="images/19_caryatid.jpg"                alt=""></p>            <p style="text-align: center;" class="indent"><span style="font-style: italic;">Cary
