Have you decided what to name me?”<br>            <br>            Jay thought for a bit. “How about Mystie?”<br>            <br>            “That’ll work,” said the fox and closed her eyes. “Good night!”<br>            <br>            Mystie fell asleep quickly, but Jay stayed awake for a long time and            stroked her furry back with his finger – he still could not believe            that he had created a real talking animal.<br>            <br>            Jay was also worried about tomorrow’s Parascience class. Their            teacher, an ex-sea captain named Sea Dog, told them to memorize the            magic Winged Words that were used to restore Neoniks’ flying            ability. It was a very long, difficult, and boring spell beginning            with “Buh-toom, duh-doom, buh-boom…” that you had to chant to a            special beat. <br>          </td>          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>          <td valign="middle" width="50%">            <div style="text-align: justify;">Mom gave Jay a double ball of              magic to practice with the Winged Words but he spent it to charge              his “spaghetti” and did not do his homework.<br>              <br>              “Sea Dog’s not likely to give us a pop quiz anyway,” Jay tried to              reason with himself. “He always gives the kids a pep talk before              summer break and then tells stories about his young days. He is              sure to get excited over that and forget about the Winged Words.”</div>            <p style="text-align: center;" class="images"> </p>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 17 - </td>          <td><br>          </td>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%">- 18 -<br>          </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </body></html>
