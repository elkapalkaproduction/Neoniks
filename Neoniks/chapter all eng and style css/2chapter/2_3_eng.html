He had a white rat to warn him of coming rockslides and gas leaks. It was the Miner&#x0027;s only friend, but he began to suspect that the rat wanted to steal his magic, and he chased it away.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;His greed exhausted him so much that his body shriveled up and he turned into a skeleton that had neither a heart nor a brain, and he couldn&#x0027;t use his magic wealth anymore. Ever since then, the Greedy Miner has been wandering around the island and pestering passersby at night, demanding that they return his rat. If you talk to him, he will follow you home and moan under your window, &#x2019;Where is my darling rat?&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
