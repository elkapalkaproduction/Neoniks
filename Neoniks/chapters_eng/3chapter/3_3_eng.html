                    <p class="indent">Jay hardly ever cried, so she was really surprised when she saw that his eyes were brimming with tears. He shoved the plate with the game away, put his arms on his desk, and hid his face.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Something happened at school,&#x201D; he sobbed.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Phoebe could fight with Jay for days on end, but she could not stand it if someone else upset him.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Did you have a fight with the boys?&#x201D; she asked. &#x201C;You want me to deal with them?&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;That&#x0027;s not the problem!&#x201D; said Jay, and told her about the sub and how he&#x0027;d taken away Mystie.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;How dare he!&#x201D; cried Phoebe, outraged. &#x201C;Who said he could take kids&#x2019; things? Especially live ones! Especially things like <em>that</em>!&#x201D;</p>

               <p class="indent">The humming of the vacuum cleaner and Dad&#x0027;s battle song were heard from the other room; it seemed that he really enjoyed cleaning up.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;If I hadn&#x0027;t caught your winged can, would it have inspired me to search for Mystie?&#x201D; asked Jay.</p>
<p class="indent">Phoebe shook her head. &#x201C;We haven&#x0027;t had Search Inspirations yet. But you can still fly to school tomorrow and ask where to find Mr. Justacreep. Do you want me to go with you?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; Jay sniffed and smiled. &#x201C;Thanks a lot!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">It was nice to have an older sister, even if she did chase you around sometimes.</p>
