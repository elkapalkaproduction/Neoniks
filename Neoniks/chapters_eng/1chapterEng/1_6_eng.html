                not paying any attention to Rusty. “We heard a pop.”<br>
                <br>
                Jay half-opened an eye. <br>
                <br>
                “I just swatted a mosquito,” he said.<br>
                <br>
                Lying did you no good – Will Power depleted very quickly if you
                did, but Jay could not show the fox to his Mom. She had enough
                problems with Sir Pomodoro and did not allow new magic creatures
                at home.<br>
                <br>
                Mom created Rusty when she was still a young witch and wanted to
                be courted by a real knight, even a little one. But Rusty
                Pomodoro turned out to be a scaredy-cat, a sloppy Joe, and a
                terrible chatterbox. He was afraid to be alone even in the
                daytime; and in order to feel secure, he followed Mom around all
                day long and nagged her with advice on improving defenses.</div>
