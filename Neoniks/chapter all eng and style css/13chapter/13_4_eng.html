<p class="indent">Furcoat jumped on the kids, but Jay managed to dodge and pick up the fox off the floor as they flew up to the ceiling. With a deafening roar, Furcoat began hurling pieces of rock at them.</p>
<p class="indent">Meanwhile, Justacreep quietly wriggled among the crocorhines, grabbed the magic tree, and started moving it towards the cave entrance.</p>
<p class="indent">He almost made it when legs as thick as tree trunks barred his way. Justacreep raised his head and saw three giant policemen.</p>

<p class="indent">&#x201C;Going somewhere with that magic tree?&#x201D; asked one of them.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Oh, I&#x0027;m sorry! I must have lost my way,&#x201D; mumbled Justacreep, backing away, but the policemen did not let him get far.</p>
<p class="indent">Furcoat, realizing that all was lost, soared above their heads in one bound and disappeared in the maze.</p>
<p class="indent">Jay, Phoebe, and Mystie came down to the floor.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Furcoat has the tracking device his chest,&#x201D; said Mystie. &#x201C;So we can always tell where he is on the map.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Jay kissed her forehead. &#x201C;You are so brave!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;It&#x0027;s you and Phoebe who are brave!&#x201D; whispered Mystie. &#x201C;You saved me!&#x201D;</p>
