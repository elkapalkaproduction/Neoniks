                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;And a first-class thief,&#x201D; said Jay gloomily. &#x201C;He stole my magic fox, and Cary&#x0027;s lacegrass, and your key.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;I think these crooks decided to rob our museum,&#x201D; said Phoebe. &#x201C;They couldn&#x0027;t simply get into the school: that&#x0027;s why they made up the story about the sub. Mr. Justacreep left Wanda in the classroom and went to the museum along with Furcoat.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">Sea Dog clutched his head. &#x201C;Oh, I am such an silly old noodle!&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">His Conscience badge started blinking again.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;What do you want?&#x201D; He was really upset now. &#x201C;I am not &#x2018;old&#x2019;? I am not &#x2018;silly&#x2019;?&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;You are not a noodle,&#x201D; said Jay and hugged Sea Dog. &#x201C;You are a nice and kind daydreamer, although you are too trusting and a bit boastful.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Thank you,&#x201D; Sea Dog smiled gratefully. &#x201C;I have an extra key to the school museum. Should we go there?&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Definitely!&#x201D; exclaimed Phoebe. &#x201C;We should find out why Mr. Justacreep wanted to get into the museum.&#x201D;</p>

                    <p class="indent">Sea Dog was not one for flying and preferred to use a boat to get to work. He was so good at driving it that he could get there in record time, despite the island&#x0027;s rapids and waterfalls.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Going down-river with the teacher was exciting but a bit scary, just like riding a very wet rollercoaster. Every once in a while Phoebe&#x0027;s and Jay&#x0027;s wings came out on their own &#x2013; that&#x0027;s how much they wanted to go up and fly away from the boat.</p>
