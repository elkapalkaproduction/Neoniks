                     <p class="indent">But the man waved to her as if he was asking her to wait. The tree&#x0027;s heart pulsed more evenly, and the kids heard the familiar beat of the Winged Spell in it. &#x201C;Buh-toom, duh-doom, buh-boom&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">A light flared behind Phoebe&#x0027;s back, but instead of the usual wings with dots she had a pair of fantastically beautiful ones with intricate patterns on them.</p>

                 <p class="indent">The tiny man waved his hand again and a shining drawing of a Willmeter appeared on the tree&#x0027;s bark.</p>
                 <p class="indent">Phoebe hugged her brother. &#x201C;I think he&#x0027;s saying that you have to measure your Will Power,&#x201D; she exclaimed. &#x201C;After today&#x0027;s adventures your level will be so high that you&#x0027;ll be able to create the most beautiful wings ever, all by yourself.&#x201D;</p>
                 <p class="indent">Returning to Cake Island, Harold, Phoebe, Jay, and Mystie went to the Main Square to watch the Jubilant Moon Festival Parade. Ghost floats that formed and re-formed into different shapes sailed by. A flight of witches, all dressed up, followed, their brooms ablaze with multi-colored sparkles. Peacocks spread and closed their tails on command, and each time the tails had a different pattern on them.</p>
