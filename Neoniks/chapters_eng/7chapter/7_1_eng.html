<p class="indent">When Mystie came to, she felt as if she&#x0027;d been run over by a toy train &#x2013; her body ached, her head was spinning, and her ears rang.</p>
<p class="indent">She was lying under an upturned plastic soda cup left on the wooden table. Mystie carefully lifted the edge of the cup and looked out.</p>
<p class="indent">It seemed that she was in a large room with a lot of metal lockers. Justacreep was there too, right by the door; he was sharpening the claws of a green dragon in shining armor.</p>
<p class="indent">Justacreep treated him very respectfully, not at all like he had treated the kids at school.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;You can&#x0027;t imagine how I admire you!&#x201D; he was saying as he tried to catch the dragon&#x0027;s eye. &#x201C;You are so strong, so powerful &#x2013; just like a bulldozer!&#x201D;</p>
