                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;You&#x0027;ll have to wait,&#x201D; said Ruben. &#x201C;The Star Fairies are going to raise the magic for the Jubilant Moon Festival now, so the exit from the volcano must be completely clear.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Where do they raise it from?&#x201D; asked Phoebe confusedly.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;From the magic tree plantation, which is directly below us, at the bottom of the volcano,&#x201D; explained Ruben. &#x201C;That&#x0027;s where the magic we all use is grown. The access to the trees is blocked by a powerful magic field called the Border of Darkness, so that outsiders cannot sneak onto the plantation. If you fly into the magic field, you&#x0027;ll think that you are going down and down forever, while all the time you&#x0027;d be staying in one place. That&#x0027;s why our island is called Bottomless.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">Phoebe&#x0027;s eyes lit up. &#x201C;Have you ever been to the plantation yourself?&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">The leomen looked at each other and smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">&#x201C;We all work there. Some of us do maintenance, some are agricultural engineers,&#x201D; answered Ruben. &#x201C;Today the Border of Darkness will be shut down for a little while so the magic for the fireworks can go through. If you want, you can see how it&#x0027;s raised. It&#x0027;s a very beautiful sight.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Of course I want to!&#x201D; said Phoebe.</p>
<p class="indent">Leomen brought out folding chairs and blankets and made themselves comfortable on the edge of the chasm. While they waited for the magic to rise, Phoebe kept looking at them and thinking that she had seen creatures like that before. She decided to ask Ruben whether they had met recently, but just then leomen began clapping excitedly.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Magic! Magic!&#x201D; they cried.</p>
<p class="indent">The gloom lessened, and Phoebe saw a field covered with twinkling lights. It looked like a starry sky was spread out below them. The lights gathered into a ball and it opened up like a flower of millions of blinking stars. Fairies in shining gowns flew up to it and carefully guided it upwards.</p>
