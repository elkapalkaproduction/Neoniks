                    <p class="indent">All this time Mystie stayed in the cup. Hearing Furcoat, she thought that they might experiment on her again and played dead.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Justacreep pulled her out. &#x201C;Why, she croaked!&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">Mystie really hoped that they would throw her away like a piece of junk, but instead Furcoat said, &#x201C;It doesn&#x0027;t matter if she&#x0027;s dead or alive.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Let me wear her,&#x201D; asked Wanda. &#x201C;I&#x0027;ll make a collar of her. It&#x0027;s not fair, Justacreep is wearing furs and I have nothing.&#x201D;</p>
                    
                    <p class="indent">Justacreep gave her the fox and she wrapped Mystie around her neck and tied her paws together with a hair clip.</p>

                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;It&#x0027;s time!&#x201D; cried Furcoat. &#x201C;The fairies have begun raising the magic flower.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">Justacreep attached the last of the demonite to the submarine and, grabbing Furcoat and Wanda, climbed in. The rotor started spinning and the submarine slowly swam out of the gate.</p>
