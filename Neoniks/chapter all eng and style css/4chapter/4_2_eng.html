   <p class="indent">Both kids and adults really liked to go there because there was no other place where you could find such delicious Sweet Dreams, Hot Topics, and Sparkling Water-Under-the-Bridge. These were the Neoniks&#x2019; favorite treats.</p>
<p class="indent">Inside the caf&#x00E9;, the walls were papered with enlarged pages from children&#x0027;s books; the chairs looked like powder-boxes with the most delicate powder-puffs for seats, and the transparent tables created a nice illusion &#x2013; the customers&#x2019; legs looked exceptionally slender under them, even those of Madame Hippo.</p>
<p class="indent">The massive wooden counter was supported by a live sculpture named Cary. Cake Island was celebrating the Jubilant Moon Festival tonight and Cary had a new hairdo with little carved roses.</p>
<p class="indent">Phoebe and Jay noticed right away that there was something wrong &#x2013; Cary&#x0027;s face was sad and she had two little wrinkle-cracks between her eyebrows.</p>

               <p class="indent">&#x201C;What&#x0027;s the matter?&#x201D; asked Phoebe.</p>
               <p class="indent">Cary pointed to a wide windowsill, which used to house pots of lacegrass. It was a very rare and fussy plant that had to be fed with cookie crumbs, sprayed with perfume, and praised daily.</p>
               <p class="indent">Now there was nothing left of the lacegrass; it was all torn up and only the roots were straggling out like thin strings.</p>
