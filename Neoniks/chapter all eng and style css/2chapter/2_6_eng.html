<p class="indent">When he left the classroom, Jay&#x0027;s friends rushed to his side and tried to comfort him.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;The teachers have no right to take our things!&#x201D; Beppo raged. &#x201C;It&#x0027;s robbery!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Don&#x0027;t worry, he&#x0027;ll give the fox back,&#x201D; said the girls.</p>
<p class="indent">Soon the principal came in and called everyone into the end-of-the-year assembly and concert.</p>
<p class="indent">Jay was supposed to sing in the choir, but he couldn&#x0027;t make a sound. He kept looking into the audience and searching for Mr. Justacreep. To Jay&#x0027;s horror, the substitute teacher seemed to have vanished.</p>
<p class="indent">The evening came and all the kids flew home, but Jay still sat on a suspension bridge across from the teachers&#x2019; lounge.</p>
<p class="indent">The cleaning lady, Mrs. Mantis, went by.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Go home! Your mother must be waiting for you,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Mr. Justacreep took my magic fox and I have to get her back,&#x201D; said Jay stubbornly.</p>
<p class="indent">Mrs. Mantis shook her head. &#x201C;There is no one there. The key&#x0027;s been turned in. Come back for your toy after summer break.&#x201D;</p>
