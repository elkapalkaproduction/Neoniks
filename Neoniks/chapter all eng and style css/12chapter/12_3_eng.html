<p class="indent">&#x201C;What if no one ever finds us?&#x201D; said Jay nervously. &#x201C;Zoe went for help, but she&#x0027;s a turtle&#x2026; who knows when she&#x0027;ll get to town?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Let&#x0027;s see where Justacreep is taking Mystie,&#x201D; suggested Phoebe. &#x201C;She&#x0027;s much worse off than we are right now.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Jay pulled Zoe&#x0027;s red button out of his pocket and turned on the map of the island.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Here she is!&#x201D; said Phoebe pointing to a shining dot in the middle of the maze. &#x201C;What do you think Furcoat wants your fox for?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">But Jay did not answer. In the glow of the map he noticed that there was a puddle of water at the bottom of the well.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;I know how to restore at least one pair of wings!&#x201D; he whispered. &#x201C;Put a small ball of magic into that puddle! I hope what&#x0027;s left of my Will Power is enough for this trick.&#x201D;</p>

                </td>
             <td width="50%" valign="middle">
<p class="indent">Jay cast the video game spell, and as soon as the water turned into a screen, Beppo&#x0027;s face appeared on it.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Hey, where are you?&#x201D; he asked. &#x201C;I&#x0027;ve called you, like, five times.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Quiet!&#x201D; whispered Jay and picked up the double ball of magic. &#x201C;I&#x0027;ll tell you about it later. Right now I need your help. Is your Will Power level okay?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;I think so,&#x201D; said Beppo.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Then say the Winged Spell for me! But please hurry, it&#x0027;s really important!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Beppo cast the spell, and a bright light flared behind Jay&#x0027;s back, his new wings flickering with tiny golden sparks.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Hurray!&#x201D; cried Jay and Phoebe and fell silent seeing the scary muzzle of the crocorhine above the edge of the well. It growled and began to throw clods of earth down at them.</p>
<p class="indent">Jay grabbed his sister under her arms. &#x201C;Hold the map! &#x201D; he yelled. &#x201C;We&#x0027;ve got to fly away or the crocorhine will bury us!&#x201D;</p>
