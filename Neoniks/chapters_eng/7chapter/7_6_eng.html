                    <p class="indent">Harold came out of the stadium, shaking with cold.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Justacreep is taking your fox to Bottomless Island!&#x201D; he said through chattering teeth.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;What can we do?&#x201D; cried Jay desperately. &#x201C;We&#x0027;ll never save Mystie without our wings!&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;There is a special spell to restore your wings,&#x201D; said Harold, &#x201C;the Winged Spell!&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;But I don&#x0027;t know it!&#x201D; sobbed Jay. &#x201C;I was supposed to memorize it yesterday, but I was too lazy!&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Maybe your sister remembers it?&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">But Phoebe shook her head. &#x201C;We had the Winged Spell two years ago and I don&#x0027;t remember anything. In any case, we would need double balls of magic and we have less than a grain. We&#x0027;ll have to go back home and wait for Mom to come back from work or manage without the wings somehow.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;We can&#x0027;t wait!&#x201D; said Jay firmly. &#x201C;Who knows what these crooks will do to Mystie?&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Then let&#x0027;s not waste any time,&#x201D; said Harold. &#x201C;I&#x0027;ll take you to the boat station; you can go to Bottomless Island from there and save your fox.&#x201D;</p>
