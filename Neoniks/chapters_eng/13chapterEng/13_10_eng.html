Even Ruben and              Lola were there, although just like Jay and Phoebe, they tried to              be quiet and not applaud too loudly. After spending a while inside              Bottomless Island their voices were squeaky and they all moved at              high-speed.<br>              <br>              Then they watched the fireworks, which were splendid. After the              Neoniks found out that the magic flower had been destroyed,              everyone chipped in to replace the magic that had been lost. <br>              <br>              When the tired but happy crowd decided to go home, Zoe the Turtle              crawled into the square.<br>              <br>              “Ha, you back already?” she said seeing Phoebe and Jay. “I’ve been              walking all day to get here and find help!”<br>              <br>              Jay and Phoebe had to smother their laughter as they thanked her              for her efforts.<br>              <br>              “By the way, what are your parents going to say about keeping that              magic fox?” Zoe asked.<br>              <br>              “Oh, we’ll deal with our parents,” replied Jay. “What Rusty              Pomodoro will&nbsp; have to say to this is a totally different              matter. In any case, we’re going to have an unforgettable summer              break!”</div>          </td>          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>          <td valign="middle" width="50%">            <div style="text-align: center;">TO OUR READERS</div>            <p style="text-align: justify;">If you enjoyed <span style="font-style: italic;">Neoniks
