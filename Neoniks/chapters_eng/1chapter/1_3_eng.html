                          <p class="indent">To be good at magic, you had to have not only the right spell and enough magic substance, but also enough <em>Will Power</em>.Will Power grew when Neoniks kept their promises or helped others, but if they broke their word or dodged their duties, their Will Power level plummeted and magic did not obey them anymore.</p>

                    <p class="indent">Jay was a very responsible boy; that was why he could do the kind of magic that other kids his age couldn&#x2019;t. But Jay&#x2019;s Will Power had recently begun to weaken, all because of the magic video games that he played with his friends. He was especially fascinated with the adventures of a white fox lost in a strange city; players had to help the fox get back home to its master.</p>
                   
                    
                    
                    
                </td>
                <td width="50%" valign="middle">
                     <p class="indent">Jay could not abandon the game halfway because he felt responsible for the fox. But since it was not real and he was not doing anything particularly useful, Jay&#x0027;s Will Power was shrinking rapidly.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Jay&#x0027;s homework for that night was to memorize the Winged Spell. It was a very long, difficult, and boring spell that began with &#x201C;Buh-toom, duh-doom, buh-boom&#x2026;&#x201D; that you had to chant to a special beat.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Jay looked at the textbook and set it aside. He decided to play a little with the fox rather than waste time on useless <em>buh-toom, duh-dooms</em>.<p>
                    <p class="indent"><em>It&#x0027;s not like I&#x0027;m gonna lose my ability to grow wings any time soon</em>, he thought. </p>
                    <p class="indent"><em>And besides, tomorrow is the last day of school for the year, and the teacher will probably forget to check our homework anyway</em>.</p>
