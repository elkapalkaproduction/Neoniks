It was a dormant volcano with a huge              well in its throat. Guides said you could go down forever and              ever, but admittedly, none of the tourists ever went very far down              because there were plenty of interesting things right at the top.<br>              <br>              On the interior slopes of Bottomless Island there were caves and              terraces that housed the most incredible animals and plants. <br>              <br>              In addition, there were several underground villages, whose              residents grew magic vegetable gardens and orchards.<br>              <br>              Inside, Bottomless Island was filled with a special greenish air              that was heavier and thicker than regular air. Those who spent any              length of time there got used to applying more effort to doing              everything. When they came out they moved at a higher speed and              spoke in high cartoonish voices for a while.</div>          </td>          <td valign="middle" width="50%">            <p style="text-align: center;" class="images"><img style="width: 449px; height: 329px;"                src="images/32_bottomless_island.jpg"                alt=""></p>            <p style="text-align: center;" class="images"><span style="font-style: italic;">Bottomless                Island</span></p>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 93 - </td>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 94 - </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </body></html>
