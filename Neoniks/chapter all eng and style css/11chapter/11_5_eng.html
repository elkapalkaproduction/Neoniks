<p class="indent">Lola led Justacreep along the path to the greenhouse where young magic trees were growing. The staff flew after them and its frowning old face kept its eyes on Justacreep.</p>
<p class="indent">When Lola bent down to pick up a ball of magic from the grass, Justacreep whispered to Wanda, pointing at the staff, &#x201C;Take care of that thing!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">They kept going, and Wanda hung back a little to attract the attention of the staff&#x0027;s young face.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;I think you must be one of the most powerful staffs in the world,&#x201D; she winked. &#x201C;Is that right?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;We&#x0027;ve got to be, by trade,&#x201D; said the young man demurely. &#x201C;After all, we protect the magic plantation.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;You&#x0027;re much more than just a plain staff! I&#x0027;ve always wanted to meet someone like you!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Wanda flirted shamelessly. She paid compliments, laughed contagiously, and asked for advice on all sorts of things.</p>
<p class="indent">Mystie really wanted to yell to the staff, &#x201C;She&#x0027;s lying to you!&#x201D; but Wanda&#x0027;s strong fingers were still squeezing her jaws.</p>
<p class="indent">The staff&#x0027;s old face wanted to see what was going on, but the young one could not pull his eyes away from the magic wand and refused to turn around.</p>

                    <p class="indent">They were nearing the greenhouse, when Wanda jumped into the bushes and beckoned to the staff, &#x201C;Come here, handsome!&#x201D; she whispered tenderly. &#x201C;Let me kiss you!&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">Forgetting everything, he plunged after her. Wanda jumped up and kissed the young face on the lips.</p>
