                    <p class="indent">Jay played for a very long time, until late at night, having overcome many dangers and tricky traps, he completed the last level.</p>
                    <p class="indent">A pink cloud rose above the screen and golden letters shone through it:</p>
                <div class="block">
<p class="center1">Congratulations!</p>
<p class="center">You have won the first prize and can now create a real fox</p>
<p class="center">that will be your faithful friend.</p>
<p class="center">Have a double ball of magic ready and write down this spell. Beware:</p>
<p class="center">These magic words are single-use only; if you make a mistake, they will be lost</p>
<p class="center1">FOREVER!</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Jay had never been so happy in his life!</p>
<p class="indent">Mom had just given him a double ball of magic to finish his homework, but now he did not even think about it. All he wanted to do was to create a real magic fox!</p>
<p class="indent">To tell the truth, Jay was afraid that he might not have enough Will Power &#x2013; not doing homework always had an adverse effect on a kid&#x0027;s magic abilities.</p>

                <td width="50%" valign="middle">
                    <p class="indent">Jay took his Willmeter, a special device to check Will Power, and shoved it under his arm. The results were dreadful &#x2013; there was just a little Will Power left.</p>
                    <p class="indent">To gain it back, Jay helped Mom in the kitchen, put away his toys, brushed his teeth, and even looked into his sister&#x0027;s room and wished her good night.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Did the good fairies put a spell on you?&#x201D; said Phoebe, really surprised. Her brother had never been very polite.</p>
                    <p class="indent">As soon as Mom closed the door to Jay&#x0027;s room, he put on his goggles, got the double ball of magic, and began to chant the spell. &#x201C;Shalaam-balaam! Abara-kadabara!&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">The spell was made up of funny words, quiet whistling, and weird dance moves.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Finally, the ball of magic shone with a lilac light. There was a pop, and a tiny white fox appeared in a cloud of mist, which slowly cleared away. She had blue eyes and a violet gem on her forehead.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Hi!&#x201D; she said.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Jay gently picked her up. &#x201C;Hurray! It worked!&#x201D;</p>
