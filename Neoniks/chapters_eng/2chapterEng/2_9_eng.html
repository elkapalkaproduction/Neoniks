          <td style="text-align: justify;" valign="middle" width="50%"> Mr.
            Justacreep tucked Mystie into the pocket of his fur coat and,
            picking up Wanda, headed for the door.<br>
            <br>
            “Give my fox back!” cried Jay.<br>
            <br>
            But Mr. Justacreep ignored him and simply said, “Class dismissed.”<br>
            <br>
            When he left the classroom, Jay’s friends rushed to his side and
            tried to comfort him.<br>
            <br>
            “The teachers have no right to take our things!” Beppo raged. “It’s
            robbery!”<br>
            <br>
            “Don’t worry, he’ll give the fox back,” said Ginger Pistachio. As
            long as she was happy her hair was red, but now it turned green with
            rage.<br>
            <br>
            The door opened again and Jay jumped up, thinking that Mr. Justpuss
            was coming back, but it was the school principle.<br>
            <br>
            “Turn your wands in and fly to the auditorium,” he ordered.</td>
