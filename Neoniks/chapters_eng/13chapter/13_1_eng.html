<p class="chap1"><strong>THE SPELL</strong></p>
<p class="indent">Justacreep brought the submarine to the hidden cave behind the oak gates.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;So, what do we do now?&#x201D; asked Wanda, bounding outside.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Bolt the gate and put the tree in the middle of the cave,&#x201D; directed Furcoat.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Are we going to grow magic?&#x201D; Wanda hopped up and down impatiently. &#x201C;Is there enough room for it here?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Furcoat paid no attention to her jabber. His eyes were shining but his voice was quiet and focused.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Draw a star on the floor and put a circle around it,&#x201D; Furcoat commanded Justacreep. &#x201C;Now take the fox in your left hand and Wanda in your right.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Just don&#x0027;t wave me around too much,&#x201D; grumbled Wanda. &#x201C;There&#x0027;s so much magic in me, I&#x0027;m afraid I&#x0027;ll be sick.&#x201D;</p>

             <td width="50%" valign="middle">
                 <p class="indent">Justacreep untied Mystie&#x0027;s paws and picked her up by the tail. She wanted to yell, but she had the amulet in her mouth, so all she managed was a little squeak.</p>
                 <p class="indent">Furcoat closed his eyes and began chanting in a low, guttural voice. It was such a powerful spell that the walls of the cave trembled and a pillar of fire shot up from the center of the star on the floor.</p>
                 <p class="indent">&#x201C;Point the magic wand at it!&#x201D; growled Furcoat, but Justacreep was so stunned by what he saw that he could not move.</p>
                 <p class="indent">Furcoat squeezed his arm and made him raise it. &#x201C;Skeletus-greedius-minerus-comus!&#x201D; howled Furcoat.</p>
                 <p class="indent">Thunder roared, and all the magic flowed from the wand toward the center of the star. Without it, Wanda turned into a toilet brush, which the frightened Justacreep threw disgustedly on the floor.</p>
                 <p class="indent">Blue sparks danced within the pillar of fire, and a huge skeleton wearing a miner&#x0027;s hat appeared in it.</p>
