We, on the other              hand, can neither talk to them, nor send them a message, they              can’t see or hear us. Only one thing is clear – they make magic in              their workshops and then drop it on the ground.”<br>              <br>            </div>          </td>          <td valign="middle" width="50%">            <p style="text-align: center;" class="images"><img style="width: 317px; height: 339px;"                src="images/49_painted_people.jpg"                alt=""></p>            <p style="text-align: center;" class="images"><em>Painted people<br>              </em></p>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 137 - </td>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 138 - </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </body></html>
