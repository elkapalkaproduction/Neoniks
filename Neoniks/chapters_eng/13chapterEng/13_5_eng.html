            have you done?” Furcoat roared furiously.<br>            <br>            He chased Mystie around the cave, breaking stalactites and            stalagmites on his way. Several times he knocked Justacreep down,            running past him. <br>            <br>            “Don’t touch me!” yelled Justacreep, grabbing the toilet brush and            brandishing it like a sword.<br>            <br>            Finally Furcoat chased Mystie into a corner. “I got you now, you            little shrimp,” he growled and got ready to squash her with his            fist.<br>            <br>            Just then the gates crashed open and a herd of crocorhines barged            into the cave. They ran into the submarine by the entrance, and            demonite flew off it all over the cave.<br>            <br>            In terror, Mystie covered her head with her paws but fortunately            none of the rocks hit her. Furcoat managed to avoid demonite by            jumping behind a pile of stones; the crocorhines that were touched            by it passed out, while the rest ran away howling.</td>          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>          <td style="width: 49.9068%; text-align: justify;" valign="middle">“Some

With a deafening            roar, Furcoat began hurling pieces of rock at them.<br>            <br>            Meanwhile, Justacreep quietly wriggled among the crocorhines,            grabbed the magic tree, and started moving it towards the cave            entrance. <br>            <br>            He almost made it when giant legs barred his way.
