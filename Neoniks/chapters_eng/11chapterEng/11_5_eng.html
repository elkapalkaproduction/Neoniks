My boss said there is            some kind of infection in the greenhouse. I’ve got to check it out,            so it doesn’t spread to the big trees. What’s your name, kiddo?”<br>            <br>            “Lola,” replied the girl. “I am the Star Fairies’ apprentice. They            are guiding the starry flower up and left me to keep an eye on            things.”<br>            <br>            “Let’s hurry to the greenhouse,” said Justacreep. “I want to get            back home in time for the festival concert.”<br>            <br>            He was so good at pretending to be a magic tree expert that neither            the girl nor her staff suspected anything. <br>            <br>            Lola led Justacreep along the path to the greenhouse where young            magic trees were growing. The staff flew after them and its frowning            old face kept its eyes on Justacreep. <br>            <br>            When Lola bent down to pick up a ball of magic from the grass,            Justacreep whispered to Wanda, pointing at the staff, “Take care of            that thing!”<br>          </td>          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>          <td style="text-align: justify;" valign="middle" width="50%">They kept            going, and Wanda hung back a little to attract the attention of the            staff’s young face.<br>            <br>            “I think you must be one of the most powerful staffs in the world,”            she winked. “Is that right?”<br>            <br>            “We’ve got to be, by trade,” said the young man demurely. “After            all, we protect the magic plantation.”<br>            <br>            “You’re much more than just a plain staff! I’ve always wanted to            meet someone like you!”<br>            <br>            Wanda flirted shamelessly. She paid compliments, laughed            contagiously, and asked for advice on all sorts of things. <br>            <br>            Mystie really wanted to yell to the staff, “She’s lying to you!” but            Wanda’s strong fingers were still squeezing her jaws. <br>            <br>            The staff’s old face wanted to see what was going on, but the young            one could not pull his eyes away from the magic wand and refused to            turn around.<br>            <br>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 143 - </td>          <td><br>          </td>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 144 - </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </body></html>
