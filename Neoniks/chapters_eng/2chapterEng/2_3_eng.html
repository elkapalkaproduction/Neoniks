              like unusual buildings,” Jay yelled over the roar of the wind in
              his face. “See that crystal ball down there? That’s Dad’s
              hospital. And that waterfall a bit further on – that’s really a
              theatre. On show days they draw the water stream apart like a
              curtain and there is a stage right behind it.”<br>
              <br>
              Mystie quietly squeaked in delight.<br>
              <br>
              Jay’s school looked like a lot of multi-colored birdhouses
              connected by suspension bridges and rope ladders.<br>
              <br>
              He flew to his classroom and stopped at the door. The teacher was
              not in yet – some of the kids were flying around the room, some
              were walking on the ceiling, and some sat in the suspended nests
              and, blocking their ears with their hands, repeated the Winged
              Words.<br>
              <br>
              Jay’s heart missed a beat – what if Sea Dog gave a pop quiz after
              all? <br>
              <br>
              Jay’s best friend Beppo flew in.</p>
