  <p class="indent">&#x201C;Isn&#x0027;t it great?&#x201D; said Ruben, turning to Phoebe.</p>
  <p class="indent">Suddenly she realized of whom he reminded her &#x2013; Justacreep&#x0027;s fur coat, it had looked just like a leoman!</p>
  <p class="indent">&#x201C;You wouldn&#x0027;t happen to know a creature that looks like you but can be worn like a fur coat?&#x201D; asked Phoebe.Ruben frowned. &#x201C;Everyone knows him around here. He was a guard at the Border of Darkness and he tried to steal magic from the plantation. </p>
                </td>
                <td width="50%" valign="middle">

<p class="indent">But the alarm went off and he was hit by lightning. He wasn&#x0027;t lucky and the healers could only save his skin. That&#x0027;s how he became a leoman fur coat.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Did you know that he is back on Bottomless Island?&#x201D; Phoebe asked anxiously. &#x201C;He&#x0027;s got friends now and they&#x0027;re up to something. Maybe they decided to steal the fireworks magic.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;You think it&#x0027;s that easy?&#x201D; smiled Ruben. &#x201C;If any magic creature or thing touches that flower, it will explode and paralyze everyone with even an ounce of magic.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Phoebe felt better. &#x201C;It&#x0027;s a good thing you are so cautious,&#x201D; she said.</p>
<p class="indent">Suddenly there was a great crash, and a bright flare lit up the inside of Bottomless Island.</p>
<p class="indent">Phoebe fell to the ground and covered her head with her hands. She expected everyone to run around screaming, but instead there was absolute silence. She raised her head and gasped &#x2013; leomen stood still as statues, the magic flower disappeared, and the Star Fairies were frozen in the air in a petrified fairy-circle.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Ruben!&#x201D; yelled Phoebe, but there was no answer.</p>
