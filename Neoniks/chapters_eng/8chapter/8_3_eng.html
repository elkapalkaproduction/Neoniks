 <p class="indent">The turtle waved to her new clients. &#x201C;Hi, my name is Zoe Hurryfoot. We specialize in instant shipping and transportation.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;We need to get to Bottomless Island as soon as possible,&#x201D; said Jay.</p>
<p class="indent">Zoe looked at him doubtfully. &#x201C;How old are you?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Jay&#x0027;s ten and I am twelve,&#x201D; replied Phoebe.</p>
<p class="indent">Zoe pulled out one of her shell plates as if it were a desk drawer. &#x201C;Here, read this,&#x201D; she said, taking out a piece of paper entitled <em>The Guidelines</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">It said that children under twelve could only use magic transportation when accompanied by an adult.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;You, boy, will have to stay ashore, and you, girl, can take the Sky Scooter,&#x201D; said Zoe and pointed to a strange vehicle that looked like an overgrown snail. &#x201C;It&#x0027;s made of pure magic.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Phoebe looked at it hesitantly. &#x201C;I can&#x0027;t even imagine driving that!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Don&#x0027;t worry!&#x201D; Zoe waved her away. &#x201C;Driving the Sky Scooter is child&#x0027;s play.&#x201D;</p>

                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;What if I get lost?&#x201D; said Phoebe doubtfully. She did not expect to have to go there on her own.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Zoe gave her an amulet with a piglet&#x0027;s snout and little wings. &#x201C;Oink-oink!&#x201D; it grunted.</p>
