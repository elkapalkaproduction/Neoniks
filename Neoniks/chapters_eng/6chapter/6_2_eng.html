                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;I&#x0027;ve seen the posters, of course,&#x201D; said Harold thoughtfully. &#x201C;Once upon a time Justacreep was my favorite actor and I even made a bet with my friends that he&#x0027;d win the Golden Blob Award for acting. But he didn&#x0027;t get any awards at all.&#x201D;</p>
    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Why not?&#x201D; wondered Phoebe. &#x201C;He is very talented.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Two years ago he put a spell on an actress. She was performing a very tricky number and she almost crashed. So Justacreep was stripped of his magic powers and now no theater wants anything to do with him.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Phoebe and Jay looked at each other.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Do you know where we can find him?&#x201D; asked Jay.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;I heard that he now works in a locker room at the Ice Stadium,&#x201D; said Harold. &#x201C;He sharpens claws for the fire hockey players. Maybe you should try there?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;The Ice Stadium is too far for us to fly to,&#x201D; said Phoebe, upset. &#x201C;Our wings are not strong enough and it will take too long.&#x201D;</p>

                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;I can carry you there,&#x201D; offered Harold. &#x201C;I can run really fast.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Thank you!&#x201D; exclaimed Phoebe and Jay and climbed on his back.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Hold tight!&#x201D; said the dragon and took off down the street at full speed.</p>
