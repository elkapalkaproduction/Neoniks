<p class="indent">After teleporting to Bottomless Island, Justacreep spread out Furcoat like a parachute and jumped into the green abyss.</p>
<p class="indent">They floated down for a long time, until they reached a large stone ledge that looked like a dinner plate stuck in a wall. Wild crocorhines lived there &#x2013; surly animals with crocodile jaws and rhinoceros bodies. They had sharp horns on their muzzles and their sides were covered in heavy plates that glowed with bright amber.</p>
<p class="images"><img width="50%" src="images/40_crocorhine.jpg" alt=""/></p>

                </td>
                <td width="50%" valign="middle">
<p class="indent">Crocorhines lived in a maze of caves, which few people were brave enough to enter. But Furcoat knew how to deal with these animals: they adored lacegrass.</p>
<p class="indent">The crocorhines had become used to the treat and, seeing Justacreep&#x0027;s top hat, ran up to meet their friend.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Ho, you brutes, how are you doing?&#x201D; he asked as he fed them lacegrass leaves. The crocorhines slurped and grunted with pleasure.</p>
<p class="indent">After giving out treats, Justacreep slunk to the cave entrance. It was completely dark and Furcoat ordered Wanda to get the magic light going.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;I don&#x0027;t wanna,&#x201D; she whined. &#x201C;I look so stupid in the magic light.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Are we supposed to wander around in the dark just to please you?&#x201D; grumbled Justacreep.</p>
