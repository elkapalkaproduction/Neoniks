                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;What should be done with a fox &#x2013; I made a fox collar of her,&#x201D; replied Wanda.</p>
                    <p class="indent">In the meantime, Furcoat, who was draped around Justacreep, was silently looking at his fellow tribesmen. His yellow eyes shone with triumph; he was glad that they were all paralyzed.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Let&#x0027;s not waste our time on the stupid girl,&#x201D; said Furcoat. &#x201C;She won&#x0027;t be able to get out of here or to contact the outside world &#x2013; all magic devices are out of order.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">Justacreep, Furcoat, and Wanda disappeared inside the submarine and it flew towards the plantation.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Phoebe was completely lost now. Where should she go? What should she do? Her tracking device was probably not working either.</p>

                    <p class="indent">From the corner of her eye she noticed a large shadow that was advancing quickly.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;It&#x0027;s us!&#x201D; cried Jay. He jumped off Harold&#x0027;s back and ran to hug his sister.</p>
