<p class="indent">&#x201C;Who could&#x0027;ve destroyed it?&#x201D; Jay gasped.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;A man who came by yesterday,&#x201D; said Cary, sobbing. &#x201C;He took me for a still statue and hung his fur coat on my head&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Excuse me, but what did this man look like?&#x201D; interrupted Jay, startled.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;He was wearing a silk top hat and he had a live magic wand.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;It must have been Mr. Justacreep!&#x201D; cried Phoebe. &#x201C;He&#x0027;s a thief!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Cary nodded her head sadly. &#x201C;Yes, he is! I didn&#x0027;t want to be impolite, so I didn&#x0027;t say anything and held his fur coat. Justacreep was arguing with his magic wand and I felt so anxious that I began to sing a song under my breath to distract myself. When he left, all our beautiful lacegrass was gone.&#x201D;</p>

                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Mr. Justacreep stole my magic fox too,&#x201D; said Jay. &#x201C;Phoebe and I want to find him. Do you know where he might&#x0027;ve gone to?&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;He&#x0027;s never been here before,&#x201D; Cary shook her head. &#x201C;I think he was just passing by, saw the lacegrass in the window, and decided to take it.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;I wonder what he needs it for?&#x201D; said Phoebe thoughtfully.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;He must be a maniac who hates beauty,&#x201D; sighed Cary. &#x201C;I overheard him yell at his wand that she was unable to do magic, &#x2018;I don&#x0027;t care about your good looks, you powerless dimwit! They were right to throw you out of the Magic Wand College for academic failure.&#x2019; He was very rude to her.&#x201D;</p>
