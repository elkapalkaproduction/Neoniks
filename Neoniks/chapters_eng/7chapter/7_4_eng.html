                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;An athlete,&#x201D; replied the dragon. &#x201C;My name&#x0027;s Harold the Unbeatable.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;You&#x0027;re too young to be &#x2018;the Unbeatable&#x2019;,&#x201D; grumbled Justacreep and put the cup back on the table. &#x201C;Oh, well, let&#x0027;s see your claws here.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">Mystie couldn&#x0027;t decide what to do. Should she yell? But what if Justacreep followed up on his threat? </p>
                    <p class="indent">And why would this huge dragon stand up for a little fox? She was less than two days old and she didn&#x0027;t know much about dragons.Mystie looked out through the straw hole and saw that Harold was also holding a cup, exactly the same kind as the one she was in. Harold made a sip and put it on the table next to Mystie&#x0027;s.</p>
                    <p class="indent">When Justacreep was finished, Harold thanked him and, picking up his soda, went to the door. No one noticed that he did not pick up the same cup as he put down.</p>
                    <p class="indent">When he was out of the locker room, Harold lifted the plastic lid. &#x201C;Hurray! Found you!&#x201D; he cried, seeing Mystie. &#x201C;I&#x0027;ll take you to Jay now. He and his sister Phoebe are waiting for us outside.&#x201D;</p>

                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Thank you!&#x201D; said Mystie. &#x201C;I was really afraid that these villains would take me with them to Bottomless Island. But how did you find me?&#x201D;</p>

      <p class="indent">Harold showed her the high narrow windows that led to the locker room. &#x201C;Jay and Phoebe went up there and saw how Justacreep shoved you under the lid.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Give that fox back or I&#x0027;ll turn you into a tadpole!&#x201D; barked a voice behind Harold&#x0027;s back.</p>
