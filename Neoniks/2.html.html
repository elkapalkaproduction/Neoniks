                    <p class="indent">Three years ago his parents cast the Winged Spell on him, and Jay learned to sprout wings on his back whenever he needed them, just like the other Neonik kids. Naturally, these wings were very simple, but Jay hoped that one day he&#x0027;d be able to create truly magnificent wings like his dad&#x0027;s. Dad was a senior magical consultant at the Unnatural History Museum, and his wings sparkled with neon lights.</p>

                    <p class="indent">To be good at magic, you had to have not only the right spell and enough magic substance, but also enough <em>Will Power</em>.Will Power grew when Neoniks kept their promises or helped others, but if they broke their word or dodged their duties, their Will Power level plummeted and magic did not obey them anymore.</p>
