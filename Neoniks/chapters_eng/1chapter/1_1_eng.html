<p class="indent">In the middle of the Sparkling Sea there was a magical Cake Island that looked very much like a glorious dessert made by a giant baker. It had layers of wonderful beaches, forests, and meadows and its towns and villages were just like sweet decorations sprinkled on top of the cake.</p>
<p class="indent">People called Neoniks lived there in wacky houses shaped like books, vases, teapots, or anything else that came into their owners&#x2019; minds.</p>
<p class="indent">In a lantern-house tacked onto a sheer cliff lived a boy named Jay.</p>

<p class="indent">Jay was ten years old and he dreamt of becoming a great wizard. To cast spells he used cool safety goggles with invisible temples and he liked them so much that he often wore them even when he was not doing anything enchanting. Jay also preferred to wear his pendant flask of magic on his wrist instead of around his neck like everyone else. That way he could roll the balls of magic out of it much quicker.</p>
