   <p class="indent">Inside, Bottomless Island was filled with a special greenish air that was heavier and thicker than regular air. Those who spent any length of time there got used to applying more effort to doing everything. When they came out they moved at a higher speed and spoke in high cartoonish voices for a while.</p>
<p class="indent">The easiest way to reach Bottomless Island was by teleporting, but it took a lot of magic balls to pay for the tickets and not everyone could afford it. It was much cheaper to rent an aircraft or a boat to cross the channel.</p>
<p class="indent">When Harold brought Phoebe and Jay to the boat station, there was no one there because all the tourists and residents of Cake Island were getting ready for the Jubilant Moon Festival.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Good luck!&#x201D; said Harold. &#x201C;I&#x0027;ve gotta get back. I still have a few playbills to put up.&#x201D;</p>

                    <p class="indent">Phoebe and Jay thanked him and looked around. There were self-propelled inflatable bananas, kayaks, and scooters on the blue sand not far from the water line; nearby a large turtle was sunbathing. She wore a hat with a jaunty flower in it and each of her shell plates had a shiny brass handle.</p>
