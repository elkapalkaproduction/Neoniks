The kids sang and danced, and the teachers gave              out prizes to the best students. Jay got a prize for his              presentation on the iron butterflies, but he was so worried about              Mystie that he could not even get a proper thank-you speech out.<br>              <br>              “I really appreciate it,” he said into the mike and with downcast              eyes went back to his seat.<br>              <br>              When the principle finally announced summer break, Jay was the              first to fly outside and begin circling around the school. But Mr.              Justpuss seemed to have vanished.<br>              <br>              One by one the kids, teachers, and parents flew away. Desperately,              Jay went down to the suspension bridge in front of the teachers’              lounge and banged on the door with his fist.<br>            </div>          </td>          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>          <td style="text-align: justify;" valign="middle" width="50%"> The            cleaning lady, Mrs. Mantis, opened the door.<br>            <br>            “Go home!
