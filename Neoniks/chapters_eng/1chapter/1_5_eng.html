                    <p class="indent">To gain it back, Jay helped Mom in the kitchen, put away his toys, brushed his teeth, and even looked into his sister&#x0027;s room and wished her good night.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Did the good fairies put a spell on you?&#x201D; said Phoebe, really surprised. Her brother had never been very polite.</p>
                    <p class="indent">As soon as Mom closed the door to Jay&#x0027;s room, he put on his goggles, got the double ball of magic, and began to chant the spell. &#x201C;Shalaam-balaam! Abara-kadabara!&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">The spell was made up of funny words, quiet whistling, and weird dance moves.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Finally, the ball of magic shone with a lilac light. There was a pop, and a tiny white fox appeared in a cloud of mist, which slowly cleared away. She had blue eyes and a violet gem on her forehead.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Hi!&#x201D; she said.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Jay gently picked her up. &#x201C;Hurray! It worked!&#x201D;</p>

                    <p class="indent">Mom came back to Jay&#x0027;s room with Phoebe at her heels. &#x201C;What&#x0027;s going on here? We heard a pop.&#x201D;</p>
