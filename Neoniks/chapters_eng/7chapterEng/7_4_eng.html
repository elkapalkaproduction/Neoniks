Be            careful though. Unlike you, Wanda and I are magical creatures and we            can’t touch demonite.”<br>            <br>            Justacreep pulled Furcoat on and shoved Wanda into the buttonhole.            “I guess we’ll be going to Bottomless Island now. We’ve got plenty            of lacegrass and demonite. Are we taking the fox?”<br>            <br>            “Sure,” said Furcoat. “It’ll come in handy.”<br>            <br>            Mystie was even more scared. She felt Justacreep picking up her cup,            and whined quietly with fear.<br>          </td>          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>          <td valign="middle" width="50%">            <div style="text-align: justify;">“Hello,” said an unfamiliar voice              with a dragon accent. “Where do you sharpen claws here?”<br>              <br>              “And who are you?” asked Justacreep suspiciously.<br>              <br>              “An athlete,” replied the dragon. “My name’s Harold the              Unbeatable.”<br>              <br>              “You’re too young to be ‘the Unbeatable’,” grumbled Justacreep and              put the cup back on the table. “Oh, well, let’s see your claws              here.”<br>              <br>              Mystie couldn’t decide what to do. Should she yell? But what if              Justacreep followed up on his threat? And why would this huge              dragon stand up for a little fox? She was less than two days old              and she didn’t know much about dragons.<br>              <br>              Mystie looked out through the straw hole and saw that Harold was              also holding a cup, exactly the same kind as the one she was in.              Harold made a sip and put it on the table next to Mystie’s.<br>              <br>              When Justacreep was finished, Harold thanked him and, picking up              his soda, went to the door. No one noticed that he did not pick up              the same cup as he put down.&nbsp;</div>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%">- 85 - </td>          <td><br>          </td>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 86 - </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </body></html>
