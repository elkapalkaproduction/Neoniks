   <p class="indent">&#x201C;That&#x0027;s Mr. Justacreep!&#x201D; cried Jay, amazed.</p>
   <p class="indent">Sea Dog&#x0027;s ears flopped down.</p>
   <p class="indent">&#x201C;Yesterday morning I had a visit from a man in a top hat and a fur coat,&#x201D; he admitted. &#x201C;The man introduced himself as a member of the Moral Standards Society and he said that he admired my exploits very much. He asked for permission to tell about them in his book entitled <em>Heroes Among Us</em> and I let him into the house.&#x201D;</p>
   <p class="indent">Sea Dog made another bubble that turned into his own pink image.</p>
   <p class="indent">&#x201C;Oh, my!&#x201D; squeaked miniature Justacreep. &#x201C;I&#x0027;m going to die of admiration! You are not just a hero; you are an Educator with a capital E! I must give you my dearest possession &#x2013; my fur coat.&#x201D;</p>
                </td>
                <td width="50%" valign="middle">
           

<p class="indent">&#x201C;My own skin&#x0027;s warm enough,&#x201D; the little Sea Dog said, but little Justacreep would not listen.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Oh, no, you must try it on! You can&#x0027;t even imagine how well the collar goes with your face!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">But as soon as the little Sea Dog put on little Justacreep&#x0027;s fur coat, it squeezed him so hard that he couldn&#x0027;t even move his tail.</p>
<p class="indent">The big Sea Dog sighed heavily and popped the bubbles.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;I didn&#x0027;t realize that the fur coat was alive,&#x201D; said the old teacher. &#x201C;And it, or rather <em>he</em>, is probably the one who is in charge of Justacreep. The fur coat told him to search my pockets and take away the key to the school museum.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;What did they want it for?&#x201D; asked Phoebe, astonished.</p>
<p class="indent">Sea Dog shrugged. &#x201C;I have no idea. But that&#x0027;s not all! After they tied me to the railing, Justacreep called the school and told them in <em>my voice</em> that I was sick and that there will be a substitute. That man is a first-class actor!&#x201D;</p>
