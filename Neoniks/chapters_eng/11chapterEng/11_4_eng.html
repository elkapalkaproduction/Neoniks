She held a staff with a knob that looked like a saucer.              It had an old man’s face on one side and a young man’s face on the              other.<br>              <br>              “Stop! Who’s there?” cried the girl. <br>              <br>              Mystie wanted to yell to attract attention, but Wanda squeezed her              jaws with her fingers.<br>              <br>              “So you’re still alive?” she hissed. “Then be quiet or I’ll make a              bath rug out of you!”<br>              <br>              When the girl saw that it was just a leoman, she calmed down right              away. “Hello! Did something happen? I saw a bright flare above.”<br>              <br>              It looked like she hadn’t realized what happened to the starry              flower. Her magic staff was just fine – the paralyzing energy had              not reached the plantation.</div>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 141 - </td>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 142 - </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </body></html>
