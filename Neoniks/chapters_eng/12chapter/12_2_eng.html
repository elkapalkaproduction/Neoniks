                    <p class="indent">Wanda&#x0027;s eyes lit up. &#x201C;I&#x0027;ll need a diamond necklace then!&#x201D; she exclaimed as she pulled Mystie off over her head and threw her on the floor. &#x201C;I won&#x0027;t have to wear this old skin anymore! It&#x0027;s so cheesy!&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">While Justacreep and Wanda discussed their glamorous plans, Jay stuck his hand under the seat and reached Mystie. None of the villains noticed him take the little fox away.</p>
                    <p class="indent">He freed her paws, and Phoebe took the amulet off her neck and handed it to Mystie. &#x201C;Here, hold on to this tracking device and try to run away as soon as we land. We can use it to find you later.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">Mystie nodded and hid the amulet in her mouth.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Jay touched Phoebe&#x0027;s elbow and pointed to the magic tree. A window in one of the painted houses opened, and a tiny ball of magic flew out of it.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Phoebe picked it up off the floor.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;It&#x0027;s too small,&#x201D; whispered Jay, aggrieved. &#x201C;We can&#x0027;t do anything with it.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;I&#x0027;ve got an idea!&#x201D; said Phoebe.</p>
                    
                </td>
             <td width="50%" valign="middle">
<p class="indent">She took the ball and, making a winged watering can, sent it back to the tree. After the Light of Knowledge was shed on it, its heart beat stronger, and soon its people pulled a double ball of magic outside their house and sent it along the path. Another, smaller one followed.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;It worked!&#x201D; said Jay, thrilled. &#x201C;That&#x0027;s enough magic to restore at least one pair of wings!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Did you remember the Winged Spell?&#x201D; Phoebe brightened up.</p>
<p class="indent">Jay shook his head. &#x201C;I never learned it. But it&#x0027;s better to have some magic reserves.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">The submarine flew into the crocorhine cave, twisted through the maze, and stopped.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Get out!&#x201D; Justacreep told the kids.</p>
<p class="indent">They wanted to take Mystie with them, but Furcoat wouldn&#x0027;t let them. &#x201C;Keep the fox with you,&#x201D; he told Wanda. &#x201C;We&#x0027;ll use it later.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Justacreep dragged Phoebe and Jay to a deep well and pushed them into it.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;That&#x0027;s your time-out,&#x201D; giggled Wanda.</p>
