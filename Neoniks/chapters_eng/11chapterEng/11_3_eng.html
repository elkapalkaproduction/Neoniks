Now he looked as if he were a real old Leoman, just              overdressed a little, his cloak covering his entire body. <br>              <br>              All this time Mystie had been motionless around Wanda’s neck. Her              paws were tied and she could not get away. <br>              <br>              Suddenly, they heard hurried steps and her heart quickened: Could              help be on its way? Maybe someone would come and set her free?</p>          </td>          <td valign="middle" width="50%">            <p style="text-align: center;" class="images"><img style="width: 348px; height: 375px;"                src="images/50_justacreep_wears_furcoat.jpg"                alt=""></p>            <p style="text-align: center;" class="images"><span style="font-style: italic;">Justacreep
