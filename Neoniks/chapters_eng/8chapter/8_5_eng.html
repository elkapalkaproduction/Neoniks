<p class="indent">She headed towards the hazy silhouette of Bottomless Island. The sun was shining, the sea was calm, and Phoebe could even see the towers of the underwater mermaid city.</p>
<p class="indent">Zoe was right &#x2013; the Sky Scooter was really easy to drive, and Phoebe made it to Bottomless Island without a hitch.</p>
<p class="indent">As she came closer, she saw the volcano crater that looked like a huge lake, except it was filled with greenish air instead of water.</p>
<p class="indent">Rays of sun illuminated the ledges deep down, while colored flying carps with long fin-wings circled close to the surface and bit off the glimmering pieces of a floating giant dandelion.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Phoebe, can you hear me?&#x201D; Jay&#x0027;s voice came over the intercom. &#x201C;Are you all right?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Yep, everything&#x0027;s fine,&#x201D; she replied.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Then start circling around and looking for Mr. Justacreep.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Okay, I&#x0027;m going down now.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">When Phoebe flew into the greenish air, it felt as if a strong scented wind was blowing up at her.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Are you there yet? What do you see?&#x201D; asked Jay.</p>

                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Red flowers!&#x201D; answered Phoebe, fascinated. They&#x0027;re bigger than me and they are growing right out of the walls! Wow, winged cats! They&#x0027;re flying around the flowers and licking off nectar!&#x201D;</p>
