                    <p class="indent">And why would this huge dragon stand up for a little fox? She was less than two days old and she didn&#x0027;t know much about dragons.Mystie looked out through the straw hole and saw that Harold was also holding a cup, exactly the same kind as the one she was in. Harold made a sip and put it on the table next to Mystie&#x0027;s.</p>
                    <p class="indent">When Justacreep was finished, Harold thanked him and, picking up his soda, went to the door. No one noticed that he did not pick up the same cup as he put down.</p>
                    <p class="indent">When he was out of the locker room, Harold lifted the plastic lid. &#x201C;Hurray! Found you!&#x201D; he cried, seeing Mystie. &#x201C;I&#x0027;ll take you to Jay now. He and his sister Phoebe are waiting for us outside.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Thank you!&#x201D; said Mystie. &#x201C;I was really afraid that these villains would take me with them to Bottomless Island. But how did you find me?&#x201D;</p>

                </td>
                <td width="50%" valign="middle">
      <p class="indent">Harold showed her the high narrow windows that led to the locker room. &#x201C;Jay and Phoebe went up there and saw how Justacreep shoved you under the lid.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Give that fox back or I&#x0027;ll turn you into a tadpole!&#x201D; barked a voice behind Harold&#x0027;s back.</p>
<p class="indent">The dragon turned around and saw Justacreep running towards him; he was waving Wanda as if he was going to put a dreadful spell on him.</p>
<p class="indent">Harold ran for it but he got lost in all the intricate stadium passages. Finally he saw a bright light at the end of the hallway. He thought it was an exit to the street and made towards it. There was a roar of the crowd, and quite suddenly Harold flew out on the ice where the fire hockey game was in full swing.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Watch out!&#x201D; yelled a huge green dragon in shining armor.</p>
<p class="indent">A stream of fire went past Harold&#x0027;s head, and the next moment he turned into an icicle, frozen by the frost-breath of another player.</p>
<p class="indent">The referee whistled and there was a great stir in the stands. Justacreep ran up to Harold and snatched the cup that held Mystie.</p>
