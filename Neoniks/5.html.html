                    <p class="indent">Mom came back to Jay&#x0027;s room with Phoebe at her heels. &#x201C;What&#x0027;s going on here? We heard a pop.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">Jay hid the fox under his pillow. &#x201C;I just swatted a mosquito,&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Where did the light come from?&#x201D; asked Phoebe suspiciously. &#x201C;I saw a light under your door.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;It was a firefly mosquito,&#x201D; answered Jay. &#x201C;It had a light bulb in its tummy.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">This didn&#x0027;t especially surprise Mom and Phoebe because there were all sorts of magic creatures on Cake Island.</p>

                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Try to go to sleep now,&#x201D; Mom said and kissed Jay goodnight.</p>

                    <p class="indent">When Mom and Phoebe left, Jay dove under the blanket again. He could not believe his eyes &#x2013; he had a real talking magic fox!</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Let&#x0027;s play, but we have to be quiet!&#x201D; he whispered. &#x201C;We can&#x0027;t have my parents find out about you or I&#x0027;ll get in trouble.&#x201D;</p>
                    <p class="indent">The fox nodded and began tickling Jay with her soft paws by running all over him. They played for a long time, trying not to laugh too loudly; then the fox wrapped herself around Jay&#x0027;s wrist like a bracelet and a wave of violet light went over her soft fur. </p>
