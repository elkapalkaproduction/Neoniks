                    <p class="indent">Immediately, his chest grew muscles and was covered with a thick fur.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Oink, oink!&#x201D; came from deep within Furcoat&#x0027;s body.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;What have you done?&#x201D; Furcoat roared furiously.He chased Mystie around the cave, breaking </p>
                    <p class="indent">stalactites and stalagmites on his way. Several times he knocked Justacreep down, running past him.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Don&#x0027;t touch me!&#x201D; yelled Justacreep, grabbing the toilet brush and brandishing it like a sword.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Finally Furcoat chased Mystie into a corner. &#x201C;I got you now, you little shrimp,&#x201D; he growled and got ready to squash her with his fist.</p>

                 <p class="indent">Just then the gates crashed open and a herd of crocorhines barged into the cave. They ran into the submarine by the entrance and demonite flew off it all over the cave.</p>
                 <p class="indent">In terror, Mystie covered her head with her paws but fortunately none of the rocks hit her. Furcoat managed to avoid demonite by jumping behind a pile of stones; the crocorhines that were touched by it passed out, while the rest ran away howling.</p>
                 <p class="indent">&#x201C;Some sleeping beauties!&#x201D; said Jay as he flew into the cave.</p>
                 <p class="indent">Phoebe was sitting on his shoulders and holding the glowing map in front of her.</p>
                 <p class="indent">&#x201C;Mystie must be here somewhere!&#x201D; she cried pointing to the blinking dot. &#x201C;We were right to bring the crocorhines here and make them gate-crash!&#x201D;</p>
                 <p class="indent">&#x201C;Watch out!&#x201D; yelled Mystie.</p>
                 
                 <p class="indent">Furcoat jumped on the kids, but Jay managed to dodge and pick up the fox off the floor as they flew up to the ceiling. With a deafening roar, Furcoat began hurling pieces of rock at them.</p>
