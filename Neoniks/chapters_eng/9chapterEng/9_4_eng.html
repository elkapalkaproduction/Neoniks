All the detectors              are set to catch intruders who use magic, and the guards won’t              even think that anyone would try to cross the border without              magical devices. If Wanda and I are surrounded by a thick layer of              demonite, we won’t show on the screens, and the ‘greatest actor of              our times’ doesn’t count, he hasn’t got an ounce of magic in him.”<br>              <br>              “I’ve got plenty of talent though!” replied Justacreep proudly.<br>              <br>              “Big deal!” snorted Wanda. “I’ve got tons of talents myself. I can              cry with a single eye and chew with a single tooth.”<br>              <br>              “And think with a single brain cell,” giggled Justacreep.<br>              <br>              Wanda jumped onto his foot so hard that Justacreep howled. “Ouch,              Furcoat, tell her to keep her handle to herself!”</div>          </td>          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>          <td valign="middle" width="50%">            <div style="text-align: justify;"> <br>              But Furcoat was not interested in their squabbles. “Check if the              fox is still there,” he ordered Justacreep.<br>              <br>              All this time Mystie stayed in the cup. Hearing Furcoat, she              thought that they might experiment on her again and played dead.<br>              <br>              Justacreep pulled her out. “Why, she croaked!”<br>              <br>              Mystie really hoped that they would throw her away like a piece of              junk, but instead Furcoat said, “It doesn’t matter if she’s dead              or alive.”<br>              <br>              “Let me wear her,” asked Wanda. “I’ll make a collar of her.
