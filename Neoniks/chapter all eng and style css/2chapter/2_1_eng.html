<p class="chap1"><strong>A STRANGE TEACHER</strong></p>
<p class="indent">Jay knew that he should not bring a pet to school, but he wanted to show Mystie to his friend Beppo so much that he decided to take her with him anyway.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;What if your teacher finds me?&#x201D; the fox worried. &#x201C;Is he strict? What&#x0027;s his name?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;His name&#x0027;s Sea Dog,&#x201D; said Jay. &#x201C;He really likes to talk about his travels and he gets so carried away that he doesn&#x0027;t pay attention to anything that&#x0027;s going on in the classroom. If you&#x0027;re quiet, it&#x0027;ll be all right.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Jay&#x0027;s school looked like a lot of multi-colored birdhouses connected by suspension bridges and rope ladders.</p>

                 <p class="indent">The classrooms were also unusual; instead of desks they were filled with cozy nests hung from the ceiling.</p>
<p class="indent">Beppo met Jay at the classroom door.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Sea Dog is sick,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I guess we&#x0027;ll have a substitute today.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Jay got the willies: what if the new teacher checks their homework and sends him home with a note? How would he explain to Mom about the double ball of magic?</p>
<p class="indent">When the bell rang, a gloomy man in a silk top hat walked into the classroom. He was carrying a very unusual magic wand in his hand and, despite the warm weather, was wearing a purple fur coat with a large animal head on its collar. </p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;My name is Mr. Justacreep,&#x201D; said the teacher without even saying hello.The kids looked at him curiously, but he only frowned and wrinkled his nose, as if he were disgusted to be in a classroom.&#x201C;Did you see his magic wand?&#x201D; whispered Beppo, turning to Jay.It was truly amazing: on one end it had an intricately carved handle and on the other &#x2013; a fancy cup with a tiny girl who sat in it waist-deep. There was no doubt that it was a wand of the best quality.</p>
