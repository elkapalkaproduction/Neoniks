Justacreep unlocked them              and walked in. Inside was a small submarine completely covered in              demonite. It had a small rotor at its stern and a cannon that shot              magic rays in the bows.<br>              <br>              Justacreep turned on the light bulb on the ceiling, and Wanda              could finally swallow the ball of magic and go back to her usual              state.

So much trouble!” he said holding the demonite              against the light. “We’ve been collecting these rocks for over a              year now.
