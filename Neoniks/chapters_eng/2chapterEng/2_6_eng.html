              “Listen to me and tremble!” she howled. “Once upon a time there
              was a Miner who lived on our island and who found enormous
              reserves of magic underground. He had a white rat to warn him of
              coming rockslides and gas leaks. It was the Miner’s only friend,
              but he began to suspect that the rat wanted to steal his magic,
              and he chased it away.<br>
              <br>
              “His greed exhausted him so much that his body shriveled up and he
              turned into a skeleton that had neither a heart nor a brain, and
              he couldn’t use his magic wealth anymore. Ever since then, the
              Greedy Miner has been wandering around the island and pestering
              passersby at night, demanding that they return his rat. If you
              talk to him, he will follow you home and moan under your window,
              ‘Where is my darling rat?’”</div>
