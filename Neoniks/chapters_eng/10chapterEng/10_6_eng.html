His yellow eyes shone with triumph; he was glad that              they were all paralyzed.<br>              <br>              “Let’s not waste our time on the stupid girl,” said Furcoat. “She              won’t be able to get out of here or to contact the outside world –              all magic devices are out of order.”<br>              <br>              Justacreep, Furcoat, and Wanda disappeared inside the submarine              and it flew towards the plantation. <br>              <br>              Phoebe was completely lost now. Where should she go? What should              she do? Her tracking device was probably not working either. <br>              <br>              Phoebe put it on her palm, but to her surprise it was still              grunting quietly. “So you are not magical!” Phoebe brightened up.              “That’s great!”<br>              <br>              From the corner of her eye she noticed a large shadow that was              advancing quickly. <br>              <br>              “It’s us!” cried Jay. He jumped off Harold’s back and ran to hug              his sister.</div>            <br>          </td>          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>          <td valign="middle" width="50%">            <p style="text-align: center;" class="images"><img style="width: 339px; height: 332px;"                src="images/47_phoebe_meets_jay.jpg"                alt=""></p>            <p style="text-align: center;" class="images"><span style="font-style: italic;">Phoebe                and Jay are reunited<br>              </span></p>            <p class="images"> </p>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 131 - </td>          <td><br>          </td>          <td align="center" height="1%" width="50%"> - 132 - </td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>  </body></html>
