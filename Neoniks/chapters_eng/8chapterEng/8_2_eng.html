It              was much cheaper to rent an aircraft or a boat to cross the              channel.<br>              <br>              When Harold brought Phoebe and Jay to the boat station, there was              no one there because all the tourists and residents of Cake Island              were getting ready for the Jubilant Moon Festival. <br>              <br>              “Good luck!” said Harold. “I’ve gotta get back. I still have a few              playbills to put up.”<br>              <br>              Phoebe and Jay thanked him and looked around. There were              self-propelled inflatable bananas, kayaks, and scooters on the              blue sand not far from the water line; nearby a large turtle was              sunbathing. She wore a hat with a jaunty flower in it and each of              her shell plates had a shiny brass handle.<br>              <br>              The turtle waved to her new clients. “Hi, my name is Zoe              Hurryfoot.
