<p class="indent">&#x201C;No,&#x201D; said the kids.</p>
<p class="indent">They had all known the story of the Greedy Miner since their kindergarten days. Moreover, many of them had met him: so there was a skeleton who wandered the streets and moaned. So what?</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;I don&#x0027;t think Wanda&#x0027;s a real teacher,&#x201D; whispered Beppo to Jay. &#x201C;She doesn&#x0027;t know how to deal with kids.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Yeah, and Mr. Justacreep is pretty strange, too,&#x201D; agreed Jay. &#x201C;I wonder where he&#x0027;s gone to.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">He had decided to show Mystie during recess, but he was so bored with Wanda&#x0027;s &#x201C;lesson&#x201D; that he could not take it anymore.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Beppo, I won a magic fox,&#x201D; he said quietly.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;No way!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Beppo also liked to play video games and he often competed with Jay on who could reach the last level first.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Look!&#x201D; said Jay and pulled Mystie out of his backpack.</p>
