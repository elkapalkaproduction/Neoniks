                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Of course I want to!&#x201D; said Phoebe.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Leomen brought out folding chairs and blankets and made themselves comfortable on the edge of the chasm. While they waited for the magic to rise, Phoebe kept looking at them and thinking that she had seen creatures like that before. She decided to ask Ruben whether they had met recently, but just then leomen began clapping excitedly.</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Magic! Magic!&#x201D; they cried.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The gloom lessened, and Phoebe saw a field covered with twinkling lights. It looked like a starry sky was spread out below them. The lights gathered into a ball and it opened up like a flower of millions of blinking stars. Fairies in shining gowns flew up to it and carefully guided it upwards.</p>

                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;Isn&#x0027;t it great?&#x201D; said Ruben, turning to Phoebe.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Suddenly she realized of whom he reminded her &#x2013; Justacreep&#x0027;s fur coat, it had looked just like a leoman!</p>
                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;You wouldn&#x0027;t happen to know a creature that looks like you but can be worn like a fur coat?&#x201D; asked Phoebe.Ruben frowned. &#x201C;Everyone knows him around here. He was a guard at the Border of Darkness and he tried to steal magic from the plantation. </p>

<p class="indent">But the alarm went off and he was hit by lightning. He wasn&#x0027;t lucky and the healers could only save his skin. That&#x0027;s how he became a leoman fur coat.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Did you know that he is back on Bottomless Island?&#x201D; Phoebe asked anxiously. &#x201C;He&#x0027;s got friends now and they&#x0027;re up to something. Maybe they decided to steal the fireworks magic.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;You think it&#x0027;s that easy?&#x201D; smiled Ruben. &#x201C;If any magic creature or thing touches that flower, it will explode and paralyze everyone with even an ounce of magic.&#x201D;</p>
