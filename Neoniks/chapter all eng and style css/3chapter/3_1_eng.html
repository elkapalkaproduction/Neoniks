<p class="chap1"><strong>THE OBNOXIOUS SISTER</strong></p>
<p class="indent">Phoebe wanted to become a <em>muse</em>. That was the name of the magic beauties who inspired poets and artists to new works of art. They lived in the middle of the sea in Foam Castle and wore long silken gowns and hooded cloaks. Just meeting a muse who was flying around was considered good luck.</p>
<p class="indent">After school Phoebe attended the Little Muse Club, and that day their coach showed the girls how to inspire students to do their homework.</p>
<p class="indent">When she came home, Phoebe wanted to have dinner, but she could not find her favorite plate.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Jay!&#x201D; she yelled. &#x201C;Did you take my plate again?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">But her little brother did not reply.</p>
<p class="indent">Seething with rage, Phoebe looked into his room. Sure enough, Jay was playing a video game in her plate!</p>
