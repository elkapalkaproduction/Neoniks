                    <p class="indent">Finally they made it to school and went up to the birdhouse that had the &#x201C;Museum&#x201D; sign. Frankly, there was nothing valuable in the museum. Jay looked carefully at the displays wondering what could have drawn Justacreep and his cronies to this place. Could it be the tank with miniature whales? Or the ghost of a sunflower the kindergarteners had grown last year?</p>
                    <p class="indent">Phoebe pointed to the mineral display. &#x201C;Something&#x0027;s missing here!&#x201D;</p>

                    <p class="indent">&#x201C;It looks like Justacreep took the demonite rock,&#x201D; said Jay and turned to Sea Dog. &#x201C;What&#x0027;s so special about it?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Demonite destroys magic,&#x201D; replied the teacher. &#x201C;If a rock like that would touch you or your sister, you&#x0027;d lose all the spells cast on you. As for magic creatures, they could lose consciousness for a long time.&#x201D;</p>
