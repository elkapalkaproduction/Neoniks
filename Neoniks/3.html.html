                    <p class="indent">Jay was a very responsible boy; that was why he could do the kind of magic that other kids his age couldn&#x2019;t. But Jay&#x2019;s Will Power had recently begun to weaken, all because of the magic video games that he played with his friends. He was especially fascinated with the adventures of a white fox lost in a strange city; players had to help the fox get back home to its master.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Jay could not abandon the game halfway because he felt responsible for the fox. But since it was not real and he was not doing anything particularly useful, Jay&#x0027;s Will Power was shrinking rapidly.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Jay&#x0027;s homework for that night was to memorize the Winged Spell. It was a very long, difficult, and boring spell that began with &#x201C;Buh-toom, duh-doom, buh-boom&#x2026;&#x201D; that you had to chant to a special beat.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Jay looked at the textbook and set it aside. He decided to play a little with the fox rather than waste time on useless <em>buh-toom, duh-dooms</em>.<p>

                    <p class="indent"><em>It&#x0027;s not like I&#x0027;m gonna lose my ability to grow wings any time soon</em>, he thought. </p>
                    <p class="indent"><em>And besides, tomorrow is the last day of school for the year, and the teacher will probably forget to check our homework anyway</em>.</p>

                    <p class="indent">He went into the kitchen, got a soup bowl, poured some water, and set a ball of magic in it. Then he said a short spell, and the water was immediately transformed into a touch-screen.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Jay checked to see if any of his friends were connected, but no one was there; apparently they were doing their homework.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><em>I&#x0027;ll play by myself, then</em>, he decided and began guiding his fox home.</p>
