            <div style="text-align: justify;">Jay’s older sister, Phoebe, wanted
              to become a muse. That was the name of the magic beauties who
              inspired poets and artists to new works of art. They lived in the
              middle of the sea in Foam Castle and wore long silken gowns and
              hooded cloaks. Just meeting a muse who was flying around was
              considered good luck.<br>
              <br>
              Phoebe tried to dress like them, decorated herself with flowers,
              and waved her hair into beautiful locks every morning.<br>
              <br>
              After school Phoebe attended the Little Muse Club, and that day
              their coach showed the girls how to inspire students to do their
              homework.<br>
              <br>
              When she came home, Phoebe wanted to have dinner, but she could
              not find her favorite bowl. <br>
              <br>
              “Jay!” she yelled. “Did you take my bowl again?”<br>
              <br>
              But her little brother did not reply.</div>
