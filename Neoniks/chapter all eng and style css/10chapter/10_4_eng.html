<p class="indent">She realized that leomen were magical creatures and they were paralyzed by the explosion of the starry flower. Nothing happened to Phoebe because she had no magic left after she was touched by demonite.</p>
<p class="indent">There was a sound of hollow chugging, and Phoebe saw a demonite-covered submarine going down. When it drew level with her, a hatch opened and Justacreep looked out, Wanda at his side.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Hey, missy, did you see our cannon hit the magic flower?&#x201D; he yelled. &#x201C;Too bad you didn&#x0027;t have any magic in you; you would&#x0027;ve made a lovely statue.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Phoebe noticed Mystie around Wanda&#x0027;s neck. &#x201C;What did you do to our fox?&#x201D; she cried.</p>
                </td>
                <td width="50%" valign="middle">



<p class="indent">&#x201C;What should be done with a fox &#x2013; I made a fox collar of her,&#x201D; replied Wanda.</p>
<p class="indent">In the meantime, Furcoat, who was draped around Justacreep, was silently looking at his fellow tribesmen. His yellow eyes shone with triumph; he was glad that they were all paralyzed.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;Let&#x0027;s not waste our time on the stupid girl,&#x201D; said Furcoat. &#x201C;She won&#x0027;t be able to get out of here or to contact the outside world &#x2013; all magic devices are out of order.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">Justacreep, Furcoat, and Wanda disappeared inside the submarine and it flew towards the plantation.</p>
<p class="indent">Phoebe was completely lost now. Where should she go? What should she do? Her tracking device was probably not working either.</p>
<p class="indent">Phoebe put it on her palm, but to her surprise it was still grunting quietly. &#x201C;So you are not magical!&#x201D; Phoebe brightened up. &#x201C;That&#x0027;s great!&#x201D;</p>
<p class="indent">From the corner of her eye she noticed a large shadow that was advancing quickly.</p>
<p class="indent">&#x201C;It&#x0027;s us!&#x201D; cried Jay. He jumped off Harold&#x0027;s back and ran to hug his sister.</p>
